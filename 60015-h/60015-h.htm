<h2 id="CHAPTER_I" class="p2 nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Under</span> its widest acceptation the word “textile” means every
kind of stuff, no matter its material, wrought in the loom.
Whether, therefore, the threads are spun from the produce of the
animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdom; whether of sheep’s wool,
goats’ hair, camels’ wool, or camels’ hair; whether of flax, hemp,
mallow, or the filaments drawn out of the leaves of plants of the
lily and asphodel tribes of flowers, or the fibrous coating about
pods, or cotton; whether of gold, silver, or of any other metal;
the webs from all such materials are textiles. Unlike these are
other appliances for garment-making in many countries; and of
such materials not the least curious, if not odd to our ideas,
is paper, which is so much employed for the purpose by the
Japanese. A careful reference to a map of the world will show
us the materials which from the earliest ages the inhabitants of
the world had at hand, in every clime, for making articles of
dress.</p>

<p>In all the colder regions the well-furred skins of several
families of beasts could, by the ready help of a thorn for a
needle and of the animal’s own sinews for thread, be fashioned
after a manner into various kinds of clothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
Sheep, in a primitive period, were bred for raiment perhaps as
much as for food. At first, the locks of wool torn away from the
animal’s back by brambles were gathered: afterwards shearing
was thought of and followed in some countries, while in others
the wool was not cut off but plucked by the hand away from the
living creature. Obtained by either method the fleeces were
spun generally by women from the distaff. This very ancient
daily work was followed by women among our Anglo-saxon
ancestors of all ranks of life, from the king’s daughter downwards.
Spinning from a distaff is even now common in many countries
on the continent, particularly so all through Italy. Long ago
the name of spindle-tree was given in England to the Euonymus
plant, on account of the good spindles which its wood affords:
and the term “spinster” as meaning every unmarried woman even
of the gentlest blood is derived from the same occupation.
Every now and then from the graves in which women of the
British and succeeding epochs were buried, are picked up the
elaborately ornamented leaden whorls which were fastened at the
lower end of their spindles to give them a due weight and steadiness.</p>

<p>A curious instance of the use of woollen stuff not woven but
plaited, among the older stock of the Britons, was very lately
brought to light while cutting through an early Celtic grave-hill or
barrow in Yorkshire: the dead body had been wrapped, as was
shown by the few unrotted shreds still cleaving to its bones, in a
woollen shroud of coarse and loose fabric wrought by the plaiting
process without a loom.</p>

<p>As time passed by it brought the loom, fashioned after its
simplest form, to the far west, and its use became general
throughout the British islands. The art of dyeing soon followed;
and so beautiful were the tints which our Britons knew how
to give to their wools that strangers wondered at and were
jealous of their splendour. A strict rule limited the colour of the
official dress assigned to each of the three ranks into which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
bardic order was distinguished to one simple unbroken shade:
spotless white, symbolic of sunlight and holiness, for the druid or
priest; sky-blue, emblem of peace, for the bard or poet; and
green, the livery of the wood and field, for the teacher of the supposed
qualities of herbs and leech-craft. Postulants, again, asking
leave to be admitted into either rank were recognized by the robe
barred with stripes of white, blue, and green, which they had to
wear during the term of their initiation. With regard to the bulk
of the people, we learn from Dion Cassius (born <span class="smcap smaller">A. D.</span> 155) that
the garments worn by them were of a texture wrought in a square
pattern of several colours; and, speaking of Boadicea, the same
writer tells us that she usually had on, under her cloak, a motley
tunic chequered all over with many colours. This garment we
are fairly warranted in deeming to have been a native stuff, woven
of worsted after a pattern in tints and design like one or other
of the present Scotch plaids. Pliny, who seems to have gathered
a great deal of his natural history from scraps of hearsay, most
likely included these ancient sorts of British textiles with those
from Gaul, when he tells us that to weave with a good number of
threads, so as to work the cloths called polymita, was first taught
in Alexandria; to divide by checks, in Gaul.</p>

<p>The native botanical home of cotton is in the east. India
almost everywhere throughout her wide-spread countries arrayed,
as she still arrays, herself in cotton, gathered from a plant of the
mallow family which has its wild growth there; and in the same
vegetable produce the lower orders of people dwelling still further
to the east also clothed themselves.</p>

<p>Hemp, a plant of the nettle tribe and called by botanists
“cannabis sativa,” was of old well known in the far north of
Germany and throughout the ancient Scandinavia. More than
two thousand years ago we find it thus spoken of by Herodotus:
“Hemp grows in the country of the Scythians, which, except in
the thickness and height of the stalk, very much resembles flax;
in the qualities mentioned, however, the hemp is much superior.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
It grows in a wild state, and is also cultivated. The Thracians
make clothing of it very like linen cloth; nor could any person,
without being very well acquainted with the substance, say
whether this clothing is made of hemp or flax.” From “cannabis,”
its name in Latin, we have taken our word “canvas,” to
mean any texture woven of hempen thread.</p>

<p>Although flax is to be found growing wild in many parts of
Great Britain, it is very doubtful whether for many ages our
British forefathers were aware of the use of this plant for clothing
purposes: they would otherwise have left behind them some shred
of linen in one or other of their many graves. Following, as they
did, the usage of being buried in the best of the garments they
were accustomed to, or most loved when alive, their bodies
would have been found dressed in some small article of linen
texture, had they ever worn it.</p>

<p>We must go to the valley of the Nile if we wish to learn the
earliest history of the finest flaxen textiles. Time out of mind the
Egyptians were famous as well for the growth of flax as for the
beautiful linen which they wove out of it, and which became to
them a most profitable, because so widely sought for, article
of commerce. Their own word “byssus” for the plant itself
became among the Greeks, and afterwards among the Latin
nations, the term for linens wrought in Egyptian looms. Long
before the oldest book in the world was written, the tillers of the
ground all over Egypt had been heedful in sowing flax, and
anxious about its harvest. It was one of their staple crops, and
hence was it that, in punishment of Pharaoh, the hail plague
which at the bidding of Moses fell from heaven destroyed
throughout the land the flax just as it was getting ripe. Flax
grew also upon the banks of the Jordan, and in Judæa generally;
and the women of the country, like Rahab, carefully dried it
when pulled, and stacked it for future hackling upon the roofs of
their houses. Nevertheless, it was from Egypt, as Solomon hints,
that the Jews had to draw their fine linen. At a later period,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
among the woes foretold to Egypt, the prophet Isaiah warns her
that “they shall be confounded who wrought in combing and
weaving fine linen.”</p>

<p>How far the reputation of Egyptian workmanship in the craft
of the loom had spread abroad is shown us by the way in which,
besides sacred, heathenish antiquity has spoken of it. Herodotus
says, “Amasis king of Egypt gave to the Minerva of Lindus a
linen corslet well worthy of inspection:” and further on, speaking
of another corslet which Amasis had sent the Lacedæmonians,
he observes that it was of linen and had a vast number of figures
of animals inwoven into its fabric, and was likewise embroidered
with gold and tree-wool. This last was especially to be admired
because each of the twists, although of fine texture, contained
within it 360 threads, all of them clearly visible.</p>

<p>But we have material as well as written proofs at hand to show
the excellence of old Egyptian work in linen. During late years
many mummies have been brought to this country from Egypt, and
the narrow bandages with which they were found to have been so
admirably and, according even to our modern requirements of
chirurgical fitness, so artistically swathed have been unwrapped.
These bandages are often so fine in their texture as fully to verify
the praises of old bestowed upon the beauty of the Egyptian
loom-work. We learn from Sir Gardiner Wilkinson that “the finest
piece of mummy-cloth, sent to England by Mr. Salt, and now in
the British museum, of linen, appears to be made of yarns of
nearly 100 hanks in the pound, with 140 threads in an inch in the
warp and about 64 in the woof.” Another piece of linen, which
the same distinguished traveller obtained at Thebes, has 152
threads in the warp and 71 in the woof.</p>

<p>Although from all antiquity upwards, till within some few years
back, the unbroken belief had been that such mummy-clothing
was undoubtedly made of linen woven out of pure unmixed flax,
some writers led, or rather misled, by a few stray words in
Herodotus (speaking of the corslet of Amasis, quoted just now)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
took that historian to mean wool, and argued that Egyptian
textiles wrought a thousand years before were mixed with cotton.
While the question was agitated, specimens of mummy-cloth were
submitted to the judgment of several persons in the weaving
trade deemed most competent to speak upon the matter. Helped
only by the fingers’ feel and the naked eye, some among them
agreed that such textures were really woven of cotton. This
opinion was but shortlived. Other individuals, more philosophical,
went to work on a better path. In the first place they
clearly learned, through the microscope, the exact and never-varying
physical structure of both these vegetable substances.
They found cotton to be in its fibre a transparent tube without
joints, flattened so that its inward surfaces are in contact along
its axis and also twisted spirally round its axis; flax on the contrary
is a transparent tube, jointed like a cane and not flattened
or twisted spirally. Examined in the same way, old samples of
byssus or mummy-bandages from Egypt in every instance were
ascertained to be of fine unmixed flaxen linen.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">For</span> many reasons the history of silk is not only curious but
highly interesting. In the earliest ages even its existence was
unknown, and when discovered the knowledge of it stole forth
from the far east, and straggled westward very slowly. For all
that lengthened period during which their remarkable civilization
lasted, the older Egyptians probably never saw silk: neither they,
nor the Israelites, nor any other of the most ancient kingdoms of
the earth, knew of it in any shape, either as a simple twist or
as a woven stuff. Not the smallest shred of silk has hitherto
been found in the tombs or amid the ruins of the Pharaonic
period.</p>

<p>No where does Holy Writ, old or new, tell anything of silk
but in one single place, the Apocalypse xviii. 12. It is true that
in the English authorized version we read of “silk” as if spoken
of by Ezekiel xvi. 10, 13; and again, in Proverbs xxxi. 22; yet
there can be no doubt that in both these passages, the word silk
is wrong through the translators misunderstanding the original
Hebrew. The Hebrew word is not so rendered in any ancient
version: and the best Hebraists have decided that silk was not
known by the old Israelites. When St. John speaks of it he
includes it with the gold, and silver, and precious stones, and
pearls, and fine linen and purple which, with many other costly
freights, merchants were wont to bring to Rome.</p>

<p>It was long after the days of Ezekiel that silk in its raw form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
only, made up into hanks, first found its way to Egypt, western
Asia, and eastern Europe.</p>

<p>We owe to Aristotle the earliest notice of the silkworm, and
although his account be incorrect it has much value, because
he gives us information about the original importation of raw silk
into the western world. Brought from China through India the
silk came by water across the Arabian ocean, up the Red Sea, and
thence over the isthmus of Suez (or perhaps rather by the overland
route, through Persia) to the small but commercial island of
Cos, lying off the coast of Asia minor. Pamphile, the daughter
of Plates, is reported to have first woven silk in Cos. Here,
by female hands, were wrought those light thin gauzes which
became so fashionable; these were stigmatized by some of the
Latin poets, as well as by heathen moralists, as anything but
seemly for women’s wear. Tibullus speaks of them; and Seneca
condemns them: “I behold” he says “silken garments, if garments
they can be called, which are a protection neither for the
body nor for shame.” Later still, and in the Christian era, we
have an echo to the remarks of Seneca in the words of Solinus:
“This is silk, in which at first women but now even men have
been led, by their cravings after luxury, to show rather than to
clothe their bodies.”</p>

<p>Looking over very ancient manuscripts we often find between
richly gilt illuminations, to keep them from harm or being hurt
through the rubbings of the next leaf, a covering of the thinnest
gauze, just as we now put sheets of silver paper for that purpose
over engravings. It is not impossible that some at least of these
may be shreds from the translucent textiles which found favour in
the world for so long a time during the classic period. The
curious example of such gauzy interleafings in the manuscript of
Theodulph, now at Puy en Velay, will occur perhaps to more
than one of our readers.</p>

<p>It may be easily imagined that silken garments were brought,
at an early period, to imperial Rome. Not only, however, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
the prices asked for them so high that few could afford to buy
such robes for their wives and daughters, but, at first, they were
looked upon as quite unbecoming for men’s wear; hence, by a
law of the Roman senate under Tiberius, it was enacted: “Ne
vestis serica vicos fœdaret.” While noticing how womanish
Caligula became in his dress Suetonius remarks his silken attire:
“Aliquando sericatus et cycladatus.” An exception was made
by some emperors for very great occasions, and both Titus and
Vespasian wore dresses of silk when they celebrated at Rome
their triumph over Judæa. Heliogabalus was the first emperor
who wore whole silk for clothing. Aurelian, on the other hand,
neither had himself in his wardrobe a garment wholly silk nor
gave one to be worn by another. When his own wife begged him
to allow her to have a single mantle of purple silk he replied,
“Far be it from us to allow thread to be reckoned worth its weight
in gold.” For then a pound of gold was the price of a pound of
silk.</p>

<p>Clothing made wholly or in part out of silk, nevertheless,
became every year more and more sought for. So remunerative
was the trade of weaving the raw material into its various forms,
that, by the revised code of laws for the Roman empire published
<span class="smcap smaller">A. D.</span> 533, a monopoly in it was given to the court, and looms
worked by women were set up in the imperial palace. Thus
Byzantium became and long continued famous for the beauty
of its silken stuffs. Still, the raw silk itself had to be brought
thither from abroad; until two Greek monks, who had lived many
years among the Chinese, learnt the whole process of rearing the
worm. Returning, they brought with them a number of eggs
hidden in their walking-staves; and, carrying them to Constantinople,
they presented these eggs to the emperor who gladly
received them. When hatched the worms were distributed over
Greece and Asia minor, and very soon the western world reared
its own silk. In some places, at least in Greece, the weaving not
only of the finer kinds of cloth but of silk fell into the hands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
the Jews. Benjamin of Tudela, writing in 1161, tells us that the
city of Thebes contained about two thousand Jewish inhabitants.
“These are the most eminent manufacturers of silk and purple
cloth in all Greece.”</p>

<p>South Italy wrought rich silken stuffs by the end of the
eleventh century; for we are told by our countryman Ordericus
Vitalis, who died in the first half of the twelfth century, that
Mainerius, the abbot of St. Evroul at Uzey in Normandy, on
coming home brought with him from Apulia several large pieces
of silk, and gave to his church four of the finest ones, with which
four copes were made for the chanters.</p>

<p>From a feeling alive in the middle ages throughout the length
and breadth of Christendom, that the best of all things ought to
be given for the service of the Church, the garments of its celebrating
priesthood were, if not always, at least very often wholly
of silk; holosericus. Owing to this fact, we are now able to
learn from the few but tattered shreds before us what elegantly
designed and gorgeous stuffs the foreign mediæval loom could
weave, and what beautiful embroidery our own countrywomen
knew so well how to work. These specimens help us also to
rightly understand the description of the splendid vestments
enumerated with such exactness in the old inventories of our
cathedrals and parish churches, as well as in the early wardrobe
accompts of our kings, and in the wills and bequests of dignified
ecclesiastics and nobility.</p>

<p>Coming westward among us, these much coveted stuffs brought
with them the several names by which they were commonly known
throughout the east, whether Greece, Asia minor, or Persia.
Hence when we read of samit, ciclatoun, cendal, baudekin, and
other such terms unknown to trade now-a-days, we should bear
in mind that, notwithstanding the wide variety of spelling which
each of these appellations has run through, we arrive at their
true derivations, and discover in what country and by whose
hands they were wrought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
As commerce grew these fine silken textiles were brought to
our markets, and articles of dress were made of silk for men’s as
well as women’s wear among the wealthy. At what period the
raw material came to be imported here, not so much for embroidery
as to be wrought in the loom, we do not exactly know; but
from several sides we learn that our countrywomen of all degrees,
in very early times, busied themselves in weaving. Among the
home occupations of maidens St. Aldhelm, at the end of the
seventh century, includes weaving. In the council at Cloveshoo,
in 747, nuns are exhorted to spend their time in reading or singing
psalms rather than weaving and knitting vainglorious garments of
many colours. By that curious old English book the ‘Ancren
Riwle,’ written towards the end of the twelfth century, ankresses
are forbidden to make purses or blodbendes (which were narrow
strips to bind round the arm after bleeding), to gain friends therewith.
Were it not that the weaving especially of silk was so
generally followed in the cloister by English women, it had been
useless to have so strongly discountenanced the practice.</p>

<p>But on silk weaving by our women in small hand-looms a
very important witness, especially about several curious specimens
in the great collection at South Kensington, is John Garland,
born at the beginning of the thirteenth century in London, where
many of his namesakes were and are still known. First, a John
Garland, in 1170, held a prebend’s stall in St. Paul’s cathedral.
Another was sheriff at a later period. A third, a wealthy draper
of London, gave freely towards the building of a church in Somersetshire.
A fourth, who died in 1461, lies buried in St. Sythe’s;
and, at the present day, no fewer than twenty-two tradesmen of
that name, of whom six are merchants of high standing in the
city, are mentioned in the London post office directory for the
year 1868. We give these instances as some have tried to rob us
of John Garland by saying he was not an Englishman, though he
has himself told us he was “born in England and brought up in
France.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
In a kind of short dictionary drawn up by that writer and
printed at the end of ‘Paris sous Philippe le Bel,’ edited by M.
Geraud, our countryman tells us that, besides the usual homely
textiles, costly cloth-of-gold webs were wrought by women; and
very likely, among their other productions, were those blodbendes
“cingula” the weaving of which had been forbidden to ankresses
and nuns. Perhaps, also, some of the narrow gold-wrought
ribbons in the South Kensington collection, nos. 1233, 1256,
1270, 8569, etc., may have been so employed.</p>

<p>John Garland’s “cingula” may also mean the rich girdles or
sashes worn by women round the waist, of which there is one
example in the same collection, no. 8571. Of this sort is that
fine border, amber coloured silk and diapered, round a vestment
found in a grave at Durham; which is described by Mr. Raine
in his book about St. Cuthbert as “a thick lace, one inch and a
quarter broad—evidently owing its origin, not to the needle, but
to the loom.” In an after period the same bands are shown on
statuary, and in the illuminated manuscripts of the thirteenth
century: as instances of the narrow girdle, the effigy of a lady in
Romney church, Hants and of Ann of Bohemia in Westminster
abbey may be referred to; both to be found in Hollis’s monumental
effigies of Great Britain; for the band about the head,
the examples in the wood-cuts in Planchè’s British costumes,
p. 116.</p>

<p>Specimens of such head bands may be seen at South Kensington,
nos. 8569, 8583, 8584, and 8585.</p>

<p>They are, no doubt, the old snôd of the Anglo-saxon period.
For ladies they were wrought of silk and gold; women of lower
degree wore them of simpler stuff. The silken snood, used in
our own time by young unmarried women in Scotland, is a truthful
witness to the fashion in vogue during Anglo-saxon and later ages
in this country.</p>

<p>The breeding of the worm and the manufacture of its silk
spread themselves with steady though slow steps over most of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
countries which border on the shores of the Mediterranean; so
that, by the tenth century, those processes had reached from the
far east to the uttermost western limits of that sea. Even then,
and a long time after, the natural history of the silkworm became
known but to a very few. Our countryman Alexander Neckham,
abbot of Cirencester <span class="smcap smaller">A. D.</span> 1213, was probably the first who tried
to help others to understand the habits of the insect: his brief
explanation may be found in his once popular book ‘De natura
rerum,’ which has been lately reprinted by order of the Master
of the Rolls.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Of</span> the several raw materials which from the earliest periods have
been employed in weaving, though not in such frequency as silk,
one is gold: which, when judiciously brought in, adds not a
barbaric but artistical richness.</p>

<p>The earliest written notice which we have about the employment
of this precious metal in the loom, or of the way in which
it was wrought for such a purpose, is in the Pentateuch. Among
the sacred vestments made for Aaron was an ephod of gold, violet,
and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen, with
embroidered work; and the workman cut also thin plates of gold
and drew them small into strips, that they might be twisted with
the woof of the aforesaid colours. Instead of “strip,” the authorised
protestant version says “wire;” the Douay translation
reads “thread:” but neither can be right, for both of these
English words mean a something round or twisted in the shape
given to the gold before being wove, whereas the metal must have
been worked in quite flat, as we learn from the text.</p>

<p>The use of gold for weaving, both with linen or by itself,
existed almost certainly among the Egyptians long before the
days of Moses. The psalmist describing the dress of the king’s
daughter (that is, Pharaoh’s daughter), not only speaks of her
being “in raiment of needlework” but that “her clothing is of
wrought gold.” In order to be woven the precious metal was at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
first wrought in a flattened, never in a round or wire shape. To
this hour the Chinese and the people of India work the gold into
their stuffs after the ancient form. In the same fashion, even now,
the Italians weave their lama d’oro, or the more glistening toca:
those cloths of gold which to all Asiatic and many European
eyes do not glare with too much garishness, but shine with a glow
that befits the raiment of personages in high station.</p>

<p>Among the nations of ancient Asia garments made of webs
dyed with the costly purple tint, and interwoven with gold, were
on all grand occasions worn by kings and princes. So celebrated
did the Medes and Persians become in such works of the loom,
that cloths of extraordinary beauty got their several names from
those peoples, and Medean, Lydian, and Persian textiles were
everywhere sought for.</p>

<p>Writing of the wars carried on in Asia and India by Alexander
the great almost four centuries before the birth of Christ, Quintus
Curtius often speaks about the purple and gold garments worn by
the Persians and more eastern Asiatics. Among the many thousands
of those who came forth from Damascus to the Greek general,
Parmenio, numbers were so clad: “They wore robes splendid
with gold and purple.” All over India the same fashion was
followed in dress. When an Indian king with his two sons came
to Alexander, the three were so arrayed. Princes and the high
nobility, all over the east, are called by Quintus Curtius “purpurati.”
Not only garments but hangings were made of the same
costly fabric. When Alexander wished to give some ambassadors
a splendid reception, the golden couches upon which they lay to
eat their meat were screened with cloths of gold and purple; and
the Indian guests themselves were not less gorgeously clothed in
their own national costume, as they came wearing linen (perhaps
cotton) garments equally resplendent.</p>

<p>The dress worn by Darius, as he went forth to do battle, is
thus described by the same historian: “the waist part of the
royal purple tunic was wove in white, and upon his mantle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
cloth of gold were figured two golden hawks as if pecking at one
another with their beaks.”</p>

<p>From the east this love for cloth of gold reached the southern
end of Italy, and thence soon got to Rome; where, even under
its early kings, garments made of it were worn. Pliny, speaking
of this rich textile, says: “gold may be spun or woven like
wool, without any wool being mixed with it.” We are told by
Verrius that Tarquinius Priscus rode in triumph in a tunic of gold;
and Agrippina the wife of the emperor Claudius, when he exhibited
the spectacle of a naval combat, sat by him covered with a
robe made entirely of gold woven without any other material.
About the year 1840 the marquis Campagna dug up near Rome
two old graves, in one of which had been buried a Roman lady
of high birth, inferred from the circumstance that all about her
remains were found portions of such fine gold flat thread, once
forming the burial garment with which she had been arrayed for
her funeral.</p>

<p>When pope Paschal, <span class="smcap smaller">A. D.</span> 821, sought for the body of St. Cecily
who was martyred in the year 230, the pontiff found the body in
the catacombs, whole and dressed in a garment wrought all of
gold, with some of her raiment drenched in blood lying at her feet.
In making the foundations for the new St. Peter’s at Rome the
workmen came upon and looked into the marble sarcophagus in
which had been buried Probus Anicius, prefect of the Pretorian,
and his wife Proba Faltonia, each of whose bodies was wrapped
in a winding-sheet woven of pure gold strips. The wife of the
emperor Honorius died sometime about the year 400, and when
her grave was opened, in 1544, the golden tissues in which her
body had been shrouded were taken out and melted, amounting
in weight to thirty-six pounds. The late father Marchi also found
among the remains of St. Hyacinthus several fragments of the
same kind of golden web.</p>

<p>Childeric, the second king of the Merovingean dynasty, was
buried <span class="smcap smaller">A. D.</span> 482, at Tournai. In the year 1653 his grave was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
discovered, and amid the earth about it so many remains of pure
gold strips were turned up that there is every ground for thinking
that the Frankish king was wrapped in a mantle of golden stuff
for his burial. We have reason to conclude that the strips of
pure gold out of which the burial cloak of Childeric was woven
were not round but flat, from the fact that in a Merovingean
burial ground at Envermeu the distinguished archæologist Cochet
a few years ago came upon the grave once filled by a lady whose
head had been wreathed with a fillet of pure golden web, the
tissue of which is thus described: “Ces fils aussi brillants et aussi
frais que s’ils sortaient de la main de l’ouvrier, n’étaient ni étirés
ni cordés. Ils étaient plats et se composaient tout simplement
de petites lanières d’or d’un millimètre de largeur, coupée à même
une feuille d’or épaisse de moins d’un dixième de millimètre. La
longeur totale de quelques-uns atteignait parfois jusqu’à quinze
ou dix-huit centimètres.”</p>

<p>Our own country can furnish an example of this kind of golden
textile. On Chessel down, in the isle of Wight, when Mr. Hillier
was making some researches in an old Anglo-saxon place of
burial, the diggers found pieces of gold strips, thin and quite flat,
which are figured in M. l’abbé Cochet’s learned book just mentioned.
Of the same rich texture must have been the vestment
given to St. Peter’s at Rome in the middle of the ninth century,
and described in the Liber Pontificalis as made of the purest
gold, and covered with precious stones: “Carolus rex sancto
Apostolo obtulit ex purissimo auro et gemmis constructam
vestem, etc.”</p>

<p>Such a weaving of pure gold was, here in England, followed
certainly as late as the beginning of the tenth century; very likely
much later. In the chapter library belonging to Durham cathedral
may be seen a stole and maniple, which bear these inscriptions:
“Ælfflaed fieri precepit. Pio episcopo Fridestano.”
Fridestan was consecrated bishop of Winchester <span class="smcap smaller">A. D.</span> 905. With
these webs under his eye, Mr. Raine writes thus: “In the first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
the ground work of the whole is woven exclusively with thread of
gold. I do not mean by thread of gold, the silver-gilt wire frequently
used in such matters, but real gold thread, if I may so
term it, not round, but flat. This is the character of the whole
web, with the exception of the figures, the undulating cloud-shaped
pedestal upon which they stand, the inscriptions and the
foliage; for all of which, however surprising it may appear, vacant
spaces have been left by the loom, and they themselves afterwards
inserted with the needle.” Further on, in his description of a
girdle, the same writer tells us: “Its breadth is exactly seven-eighths
of an inch. It has evidently proceeded from the loom;
and its two component parts are a flattish thread of pure gold,
and a thread of scarlet silk.” Another very remarkable piece, a
fragment (probably) of a stole, was also found lately at Durham in
the grave of bishop Pudsey, who was buried about the middle of
the twelfth century. This was exhibited at the Society of antiquaries,
in the present year, 1875. It is made of rich silk, with a
diaper pattern in gold thread.</p>

<p>This love for such glittering attire, not only for sacred use but
secular wear, lasted long in England. The golden webs went
under different names; at first they were called “ciclatoun,” “siglaton,”
or “siklatoun,” as the writer’s fancy led him to spell the
Persian word common for them at the time throughout the east.</p>

<p>By the old English ritual plain cloth of gold was allowed, as
now, to be used for white when that colour happened to be
ordered by the rubric. Thus in the reign of Richard the second,
among the vestments at the chapel of St. George, Windsor castle,
there was “one good vestment of cloth of gold:” and St. Paul’s,
London, had at the end of the thirteenth century two amices
embroidered with pure gold.</p>

<p>This splendid web was often wrought so thick and strong
that each string, whether it happened to be of hemp or of silk had
in the warp six threads, while the weft was of flat gold shreds.
Hence such a texture was called “samit,” a word shortened from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
its first and old Byzantine name “exsamit.” The quantity of this
costly cloth kept in the wardrobe of Edward the first was so great,
that the nobles of that king were allowed to buy it out of the
royal stores; for instance, four pieces at thirty shillings each were
sold to Robert de Clifford, and another piece at the same price
to Thomas de Cammill. Not only Asia minor but the island of
Cyprus, the city of Lucca, and Moorish Spain, sent us these rich
tissues. With other things left at Haverford castle by Richard
the second were twenty-five cloths of gold of divers suits, of
which four came from Cyprus, the others from Lucca: “xxv.
draps d’or de diverses suytes dount iiii. de <i>Cipres</i> les autres de
<i>Lukes</i>.” How Edward the fourth liked cloth of gold for his personal
wear may be gathered from his wardrobe accounts, edited
by Nicolas; and the lavish use of this stuff ordered by Richard
the third for his coronation is recorded in the Antiquarian Repertory.</p>

<p>A “gowne of cloth-of-gold, furred with pawmpilyon, ayenst
Corpus Xpi day” was bought for Elizabeth of York, afterwards
queen of Henry the seventh, for her to wear as she walked in the
procession on that great festival. The affection shown by Henry
the eighth and all our nobility, men and women, of the time, for
cloth of gold in their garments was unmistakingly set forth in
many of the paintings brought together in the very instructive
exhibition of national portraits in 1866, in the South Kensington
museum. The price of this stuff seems to have been costly; for
princess (afterwards queen) Mary, thirteen years before she came
to the throne, “payed to Peycocke, of London, for xix yerds
iii. qřt of clothe of golde at xxxviij.š the yerde, xxxvij<i>li.</i> x<i>s.</i> vj<i>d.</i>”
And for “a yerde and d<sup>r</sup> qřt of clothe of siluer xl<i>s.</i>”</p>

<p>As between common silk and satin there runs a broad difference
in appearance, one being dull, the other smooth and glossy,
so there is a great distinction to be made among cloths of gold;
some are, so to say, dead; others, brilliant and sparkling. When
the gold is twisted into its silken filament it takes the deadened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
look; when the flattened, filmy strip of metal is rolled about it so
evenly as to bring its edges close to one another, it seems to be
one unbroken wire of gold, sparkling and lustrous. This kind
during the middle ages went by the term of Cyprus gold; and rich
samits woven with it were allied damasks of Cyprus.</p>

<p>As time went on cloths of gold had other names. What the
thirteenth century called, first, “ciclatoun,” then “baudekin,”
afterward “nak,” was called, two hundred years later, “tissue”:
a bright shimmering golden textile. The very thin smooth paper
which still goes by the name of tissue-paper was originally made
to be put between the folds of this rich stuff to prevent fraying or
tarnish, when laid by.</p>

<p>The gorgeous and entire set of vestments presented to the
altar at St. Alban’s abbey, by Margaret, duchess of Clarence,
<span class="smcap smaller">A. D.</span> 1429, and made of the cloth of gold commonly called
“tyssewys,” must have been as remarkable for the abundance and
purity of the gold in its texture, as for the splendour of the
precious stones set on it and the exquisite beauty of its embroideries.
The large number of vestments made out of gold
tissue, and of crimson, light blue, purple, green, and black, once
belonging to York cathedral, are all duly registered in the valuable
“Fabric rolls” of that church lately published by the Surtees
society.</p>

<p>Among the many rich and costly vestments in Lincoln cathedral,
some were made of this sparkling golden tissue contra-distinguished
in its inventory from the duller cloth of gold, thus:
“Four good copes of blew tishew with orphreys of red cloth of
gold, wrought with branches and leaves of velvet;” “a chesable
with two tunacles of blew tishew having a precious orphrey of
cloth of gold.”</p>

<p>Silken textures ornamented with designs in copper gilt thread
were manufactured and honestly sold for what they really were:
of such inferior quality we find mention in the inventory of vestments
at Winchester cathedral, drawn up by order of Henry the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
eighth, where we read of “twenty-eight copys of white bawdkyne,
woven with copper gold.” Another imitation of woof of gold was
possibly fraudulent. This, originally perhaps Saracenic, was practised
by the Spaniards of the south, and was not easily discovered.
The very finest skins were sought out for the purpose, as thin as
that now rare kind of vellum called “uterine” by collectors of
manuscripts. These were heavily gilt and then cut into very
narrow strips, to be used instead of the true golden thread.</p>

<p>The gilding of fine silk and canvas in imitation of cloth of
gold, like our gilding of wood and other substances, was also
sometimes resorted to for splendour’s sake on temporary occasions;
such, for instance, as some stately procession or a solemn
burial service. Mr. Raine tells us he found in a grave at Durham,
among other textiles, “a robe of thinnish silk; the ground colour
of the whole is amber; and the ornamental parts were literally
covered with <i>leaf gold</i>, of which there remained distinct and very
numerous portions.” In the churchyard of Cheam, Surrey, in
1865, the skeleton of a priest was found who had been buried
some time during the fourteenth century; around the waist was a
flat girdle made of brown silk that had been gilt. In the ‘Romaunt
of the rose’ translated by Chaucer, dame Gladnesse is
thus <span class="locked">described:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">—in an over gilt samite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clad she was;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and on a piece of German orphrey-web, in the South Kensington
collection, no. 1373, and probably made at Cologne in the sixteenth
century, the gold is laid by the gilding process.</p>

<p>Silver also, as well as gold, was hammered out into very thin
sheets which were cut into narrow long shreds to be woven,
unmixed with anything else, into a web for garments. Of this
we have a striking illustration in the Acts of the apostles, where
St. Luke, speaking of Herod Agrippa, says that he presented himself
to the people arrayed in kingly apparel, who, to flatter him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
shouted that his was the voice not of a man but of a god; and
forthwith he was smitten by a loathsome disease which shortly
killed him. This royal robe, as Josephus informs us, was a tunic
made of silver and wonderful in its texture.</p>

<p>Intimately connected with the raw materials, and how they
were wrought in the loom, is the question about the time when
wire drawing was found out. At what period and among what
people the art of working up pure gold, or gilded silver, into
a long, round, hair-like thread—into what may be correctly called
“wire”—began, is quite unknown. That with their mechanical
ingenuity the ancient Egyptians bethought themselves of some
method for the purpose is not unlikely. From Sir Gardiner
Wilkinson we learn that at Thebes were found objects which appeared
to be made of gold wire. We may fairly presume that the
work upon the corslets of king Amasis, already spoken of as done
by the needle in gold, required by its minuteness that the metal
should be not flat but in the shape of wire. By delicate management
perhaps of the fingers, the narrow flat strips might have
been pinched or doubled up so that the two edges should meet,
and then rubbed between two pieces of hard material a golden
wire of the required fineness would be produced. In Etruscan and
Greek jewellery wire is often to be found; but in all instances it
is so well shaped and so even that it must have been fashioned by
some rolling process. The filigree work of the middle ages is
often very fine and delicate. Probably the embroidery which we
read of in the descriptions of the vestments belonging to our old
churches (for instance “An amice embroidered with pure gold”)
was worked with gold wire. To go back to Anglo-saxon times in
this country, such gold wire would seem to have been then well
known and employed, since in Peterborough minster there were
two golden altar-cloths: “ii. gegylde þeofad sceatas;” and there
were at Ely cathedral “two girdles of gold wire” in the reign of
William Rufus.</p>

<p>The first use of a wire-drawing machine seems to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
about the year 1360, at Nuremberg; and it was not until two hundred
years after, in 1560, that the method was brought to England.
Two examples of a stuff with pure wire in it may be seen in the
South Kensington collection, nos. 8581 and 8228.</p>

<p>The process of twining long narrow strips of gold, or gilt
silver, round a line of silk or flax and thus producing gold thread
is much earlier than has been supposed; and when Attalus’s name
was bestowed upon a new method of interweaving gold with wool
or linen, thence called “Attalic,” it was probably because he
suggested to the weaver the introduction of the long-known
golden thread as a woof into the textiles from his loom. It would
seem, from a passage in Claudian, that ladies at an early Christian
period used to spin their own gold thread. Writing at the end of
the fourth century, the poet thus compliments Proba:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The joyful mother plies her learned hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And works all o’er the trabea golden bands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draws the thin strips to all their length of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make the metal meaner threads enfold.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The superior quality of some gold thread was known to the
mediæval world under the name of the place where it had been
made. Thus we find mention at one time of Cyprus gold thread;
“a vestment embroidered with eagles of gold of Cyprus:” later,
of Venice gold thread, “for frenge of gold of Venys at vj<i>s.</i> the
ounce;” and again, “one cope of unwatered camlet laid with
strokes of Venis gold.” What may have been their difference
cannot now be pointed out: perhaps the Cyprian thread was
esteemed because its somewhat broad shred of flat gold was
wound about the hempen twist beneath it so nicely as to have
the smooth unbroken look of gold wire; while the manufacture of
Venice showed everywhere the twisting of common thread.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> earlier times, as at present, silks had various names, distinguishing
either their kind of texture, their colour, the design
woven on them, the country from which they were brought, or the
use for which, on particular occasions, they happened to be
especially set apart.</p>

<p>All these designations are of foreign growth; some sprang up
in the seventh and following centuries at Byzantium; some are
half Greek, half Latin, jumbled together; others, borrowed from
the east, are so shortened, so badly and variously spelt, that their
Arabic or Persian derivation can be hardly recognized at present.
Yet without some slight knowledge of them we hardly understand
a great deal belonging to trade, and the manners of the
times glanced at by old writers; much less can we see the true
meaning of many passages in our mediæval English poetry.</p>

<p>Among the terms significative of the kind of web, or mode
of getting up some sorts of silk, we have <i>Holosericum</i>, the texture
of which is warp and woof wholly pure silk. From a passage in
Lampridius we learn that so early as the reign of Alexander
Severus the difference between “vestes holosericæ” and “subsericæ”
was strongly marked, and that <i>subsericum</i> implied that
the texture was not entirely but in part, probably the woof,
of silk.</p>

<p><i>Examitum</i>, <i>xamitum</i>, or, as it is called in old English documents,
<i>samit</i>, is made up of two Greek words, ἑξ, “six,” and μίτοι,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
“threads;” the number of the strings in the warp of the texture.
It is evident that stuffs woven so thick must have been of the best
quality. Hence, to say of any silken tissue that it was “examitum”
or “samit” meant that it was six-threaded, and therefore
costly and splendid. At the end of the thirteenth and beginning
of the fourteenth centuries “examitum” was much used
for vestments in Evesham abbey, as we gather from the chronicle
of that house, published lately for the Master of the Rolls.
About the same period among the best copes, chasubles, and
vestments in St. Paul’s, London, many were made of samit. So,
again among the nine gorgeous chasubles bequeathed to Durham
cathedral by its bishop in 1195, the chief was of red samit
superbly embroidered. And, to name no more, we find in the
valuable inventory, lately published, of the rich vestments belonging
to Exeter cathedral in 1277 that the best of its numerous
chasubles, dalmatics, and copes, were made of samit. In a later
document, <span class="smcap smaller">A. D.</span> 1327, this precious silk is termed “samicta.”</p>

<p>The poets did not forget to array their knights and ladies in
this gay attire. When Sir Lancelot of the lake brought back
Gawain to king Arthur:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Launcelot and the queen were cledde<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In robes of a rich wede,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of samyte white, with silver shredde:<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The other knights everichone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In samyte green of heathen land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their kirtles, ride alone.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In his ‘Romaunt of the rose,’ Chaucer describes the dress
of Mirth thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Full yong he was, and merry of thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in samette, with birdes wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with gold beaten full fetously,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bodie was clad full richely.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Many of the beautifully figured damasks in the South Kensington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
collection are what anciently were known as “samits;” and
if they really be not six-thread, according to the etymology of
their name, it is because at a very early period the stuffs so called
ceased to be woven of such a thickness.</p>

<p>The strong silks of the present day with the thick thread called
“organzine” for the woof, and a slightly thinner thread known by
the technical name of “tram” for the warp, may be taken to
represent the old “examits.”</p>

<p>No less remarkable for the lightness of its texture than was
the samit on account of the thick substance of its web, and quite
as much sought after, was another kind of thin glossy silken stuff
“wrought in the orient,” and here called first by the Persian name
which came with it, <i>ciclatoun</i>, that is, bright and shining; but
afterwards <i>sicklatoun</i>, <i>siglaton</i>, <i>cyclas</i>. Sometimes a woof of golden
thread lent it still more glitter; and it was used both for ecclesiastical
vestments and for secular articles of stately dress. In the
inventory of St. Paul’s cathedral, 1295, there was a cope made of
cloth of gold, called ciclatoun: “capa de panno aureo qui vocatur
ciclatoun.” Among the booty carried off by the English when
they sacked the camp of Saladin,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">King Richard took the pavillouns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sendal, and of cyclatoun.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">In his ‘Rime of Sire Thopas,’ Chaucer says</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of Brugges were his hosen broun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His robe was of ciclatoun.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Though so light and thin, this cloak of “ciclatoun” was often
embroidered in silk and had golden ornaments sewn on it; we
read in the ‘Metrical romances’ of a maiden who sat</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Knights in the field wore over their armour a long sleeveless
gown slit up almost to the waist on both sides; sometimes of
“samit,” often of “cendal,” oftener still of “ciclatourn:” and the
name of the gown itself, shortened from the material, became
known as “cyclas.” Matthew of Westminster records that when
Edward the first knighted his son in Westminster abbey he sent
to three hundred sons of the nobility, whom the prince was afterward
to dub knights in the same church, a most splendid gift of
attire, fitting for the ceremony; among which were clycases
woven with gold. That these garments were very light and thin
we gather from the quiet wit of John of Salisbury, who jeers a man
affecting to perspire in the depth of winter, though clad in nothing
but his fine cyclas.</p>

<p>Not so costly was a silken stuff known as <i>cendal</i>, <i>cendallus</i>,
<i>sandal</i>, <i>sandalin</i>, <i>cendatus</i>, <i>syndon</i>, <i>syndonus</i>, as the way of writing
the word altered as time went on. When Sir Guy of Warwick
was knighted,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And with him twenty good gomes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knightes’ and barons’ sons,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Was the dobbing in each deal.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Roll of Caerlaverock tells us that among the grand array
which joined Edward the first at Carlisle in 1300, there was to be
seen many a rich caparison embroidered upon cendal and samit:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">La ot meint riche guarnement<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brodé sur sendaus e samis:<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and Lacy, earl of Lincoln, leading the first squadron, hoisted his
banner made of yellow cendal blazoned with a lion rampant purpre</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Baner out de un cendal safrin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O un lioun rampant purprin.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>When Sir Bevis of Southampton wished to keep himself
unknown at a tournament, we thus read of him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sir Bevis disguised all his weed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of black cendal and of rede,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flourished with roses of silver bright, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Of the ten silken albs which Hugh Pudsey left to Durham,
two were made of samit and two of cendal, or as the bishop calls
it, <i>sandal</i>. Exeter cathedral had a red cope with a green lining
of sandal and a cape of sandaline: “Una capa de sandalin.”
Piers Ploughman speaks thus to the women of his day:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And ye lovely ladies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With youre long fyngres,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ye have silk and sandal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sowe, whan tyme is.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chesibles for chapeleyns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chirches to honoure, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>A stronger kind of cendal was wrought and called, in the Latin
inventories of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, “cendatus
afforciatus:” there was a cope of this material at St. Paul’s, and
another cope of cloth of gold was lined with it.</p>

<p><i>Syndonus</i> or <i>Sindonis</i>, as it would seem, was a bettermost sort
of cendal. St. Paul’s had a chasuble as well as a cope of this
fabric.</p>

<p><i>Taffeta</i>, if not a thinner, was a less costly silken stuff than
cendal; which word, to this day, is used in the Spanish language,
and is defined to be a thin transparent textile of silk or linen:
“Tela de seda ó lino muy delgada y trasparente.” Taffeta and
cendal were used for linings in mediæval England. Chaucer says
of his “doctour of phisike,”</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In sanguin and in perse he clad was alle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lined with taffeta and with sendalle.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><i>Sarcenet</i> during the fifteenth century took by degrees the place
of cendal, at least here in England.</p>

<p>By some improvement in their weaving of cendal, the Saracens
in the south of Spain earned for this light web a good name in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
our markets, and it became much sought for here. Among other
places, York cathedral had several sets of curtains for its high
altar, “de sarcynet.” At first this stuff was called from its makers
“saracenicum.” But, in Anglicising, the name was shortened
into “sarcenet;” a word which we use now for the thin silk
which of old was known among us as “cendal.”</p>

<p><i>Satin</i>, though far from being so common as other silken
textures, was not unknown to England in the middle ages; and
Chaucer speaks of it in his ‘Man of lawes tale:’</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In Surrie whilom dwelt a compagnie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of chapmen rich, and therto sad and trewe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wide were senten hir spicerie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothes of gold, and satins rich of hewe.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>When satin first appeared in trade it was called round the
shores of the Mediterranean “aceytuni.” The term slipped
through early Italian lips into “zetani;” coming westward this
name, in its turn, dropped its “i,” and smoothed itself into “satin.”
So, also, it is called in France; while in Italy it now goes by the
name of “raso,” and the Spaniards keep up its first designation.</p>

<p>In the earlier inventories of church vestments no mention can
be found of satin; but this fine silk is spoken of among the various
rich bequests made to his cathedral at Exeter by bishop Grandison,
about 1340; though later, and especially in the royal wardrobe
accompts, it is very commonly specified. Hence we may fairly
assume that till the fourteenth century satin was unknown in
England; afterwards it met with much favour. Flags were made
of it. On board the stately ship in which Beauchamp earl of
Warwick, in the reign of Henry the sixth, sailed from England to
France, there were flying “three penons of satten,” besides “sixteen
standards of worsted entailed with a bear and a chain,” and
a great streamer of forty yards in length and eight yards in breadth,
with a great bear and griffin holding a ragged staff poudred full of
ragged staffs. Like other silken textiles, satin seems to have
been in some instances interwoven with flat gold thread: for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
example, Lincoln had of the gift of one of its bishops eighteen
copes of red tinsel sattin with orphreys of gold.</p>

<p>Though not often, yet sometimes we read of a silken stuff
called <i>cadas</i>, <i>carda</i>, <i>carduus</i>, and used for inferior purposes. The
outside silk on the cocoon is of a poor quality compared with the
inner filaments, from which it is kept apart in reeling, and set
aside for other uses. We find mention of such cloths as belonging
to the cathedrals of Exeter and St. Paul’s in the thirteenth century.
More frequently, instead of being spun, it served as wadding
in dress: on the barons at the siege of Caerlaverock might be
seen many a rich gambeson garnished with silk, cadas, and
cotton:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meint riche gamboison guarni<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De soi, de cadas e coton.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The quantity of card purchased for the royal wardrobe, in the
year 1299, is set forth in the Liber quotidianus.</p>

<p><i>Camoca</i>, <i>camoka</i>, <i>camak</i>, as the name is differently written, was
a textile of which in England we hear nothing before the latter
end of the fourteenth century. No sooner did it make its appearance
than this camoca rose into great repute; the Church used it
for her vestments, and royalty employed it for dress as well as in
adorning palaces, especially in draping beds of state. In the year
1385, besides some smaller articles, the royal chapel in Windsor
castle had a whole set of vestments and other ornaments for the
altar, of white camoca; and our princes must have arrayed themselves,
on grand occasions, in the same material; for Herod, in
one of the Coventry mysteries—the adoration of the Magi—is
made to boast of himself: “In kyrtyl of cammaka kynge am I
cladde.” But it was in draping its state-beds that our ancient
royalty showed its affection for camoca. Edward the Black
Prince bequeaths to his confessor “a large bed of red camoca
with our arms embroidered at each corner,” and the prince’s
mother leaves to another of her sons “a bed of red camak.”
Edward lord Despencer, in 1375, wills to his wife “my great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
bed of blue camaka, with griffins, also another bed of camaka,
striped with white and black.” What may have been the real
texture of this stuff, thought so magnificent, we do not positively
know, but it was probably woven of fine camels’ hair and silk,
and of Asiatic workmanship.</p>

<p>From this mixed web we pass to another more precious, the
<i>Cloth of Tars</i>; which we presume to have been the forerunner of
the now celebrated cashmere, and together with silk made of the
downy wool of goats reared in several parts of Asia, but especially
in Tibet.</p>

<p><i>Velvet</i> is a silken textile, the history of which has still to be
written. Of the country whence it first came, or the people who
were the earliest to hit upon the happy way of weaving it, we
know nothing. A very old piece was in the beautiful crimson
cope embroidered by English hands in the fourteenth century,
now kept at the college of Mount St. Mary, Chesterfield.</p>

<p>We are probably indebted to central Asia, or perhaps China,
for velvet as well as satin; and among the earliest places in
Europe where it was manufactured, were perhaps first the south of
Spain, and then Lucca.</p>

<p>In the earliest of the inventories which we have of church
vestments, that of Exeter cathedral, 1277, velvet is not spoken of;
but in St. Paul’s, London, <span class="smcap smaller">A. D.</span> 1295, there is some notice of
velvet with its kindred web “fustian,” for chasubles. Velvet is
for the first time mentioned at Exeter in 1327, but as in two
pieces not made up, of which some yards had been then sold for
vestment-making. From the middle of the fourteenth century
velvet is of common occurrence.</p>

<p>The name itself of velvet, “velluto,” seems to point out Italy
as the market through which we got it from the east, for the word
in Italian indicates something which is hairy or shaggy, like an
animal’s skin.</p>

<p><i>Fustian</i> was known at the end of the thirteenth century. St.
Paul’s cathedral at that date had “a white chasuble of fustian.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
In an English sermon preached at the beginning of the same
century great blame is found with the priest who had his chasuble
made of middling fustian: “þe meshakele of medeme fustian.”
As then wove, fustian had a short nap on it, and one of the
domestic uses to which during the middle ages it had been put
was for bed clothes, as thick undersheets. Lady Bargavenny
bequeaths, in 1434, “A bed of gold of swans, two pair sheets of
raynes (fine linen, made at Rheims), a pair of fustians, six pair of
other sheets, etc.” It is not unlikely that this stuff may have
hinted to the Italians the way of weaving silk in the same manner,
and so of producing velvet. Other nations took up the manufacture,
and the weaving of velvet was wonderfully improved. It
became diapered and, upon a ground of silk or of gold, the
pattern came out in a bold manner, with a raised pile. At last,
the most beautiful of all manners of diapering, namely, making
the pattern to show itself in a double pile, one pile higher than
the other and of the same tint, now, as formerly, known as velvet
upon velvet, was brought to its highest perfection; and velvets in
this fine style were wrought in greatest excellence in Italy, in
Spain and in Flanders. Our old inventories often specify these
differences in the making of the web. York cathedral had “four
copes of crimson velvet plaine, with orphreys of clothe of goulde,
for standers;” “a greene cushion of raised velvet;” and “a cope
of purshed velvet (redd):” “purshed” means that the velvet was
raised in a network pattern.</p>

<p><i>Diaper</i> was a silken fabric, held everywhere in high estimation
during many hundred years, both abroad and in England. We
know this from documents beginning with the eleventh century:
but the origin of the name is uncertain. Possibly, in order to
indicate a one-coloured yet patterned silk, which diaper is, the
Byzantine Greeks of the early middle ages invented the term
διαςπρὸν, diaspron, from διαςπαω, I separate, to signify “what
distinguishes or separates itself from things about it,” as every
pattern does on a one-coloured silk. With this textile the Latins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
took the name for it from the Greeks and called it “diasper,”
which in English has been moulded into “diaper.” In the year
1066 the empress Agnes gave to Monte Cassino a diaper-chasuble
of cloth of gold, “planetam diasperam.” This early mention of
the name seems to be a conclusive argument against those writers
who derive it from Yprès, in Flanders; a town celebrated for linen
manufactures at a somewhat later period: yet even then, according
to Chaucer, rivalled by workwomen in England. He tells us
of the “good wif of Bathe” that</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of cloth-making she hadde swiche an haunt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She passed hem of Ipres and of Gaunt.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">In the South Kensington collection, no. 1270 shows how these
cloths were wrought; and it would seem that cloth of gold was
often diapered with a pattern, at least in the time of Chaucer, who
describes it on the housing of a king’s horse:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">——trapped in stele,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Covered with cloth of gold diapred wele.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Church inventories make frequent mention of such diapered
silks for vestments. Exeter cathedral had a cope of white diaper
with half moons, the gift of bishop Bartholomew, in 1161. Sometimes
the pattern of the diapering is noticed; for instance, at St.
Paul’s, “a chasuble of white diaper, with coupled parrots in places,
among branches.” Probably the most elaborate specimen of
diaper-weaving on record is that which Edmund, earl of Cornwall,
gave to the same cathedral; “a cope of a certain diaper of Antioch
colour covered with trees and diapered birds, of which the heads,
breasts and feet, as well as the flowers on the tress, were woven
in gold thread.”</p>

<p>By degrees the word “diaper” became widened in its meaning.
Not only all sorts of textile, whether of silk, of linen, or of
worsted, but the walls of a room were said to be diapered when
the self-same ornament was repeated and sprinkled well over it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
Thus, in ‘the squire of low degree,’ the king of Hungary promises
his daughter a chair or carriage, that</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shal be coverd wyth velvette reede<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clothes of fyne golde al about your heede,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With damaske whyte and azure blewe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well dyaperd with lylles newe.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The bow for arrows held by Sweet-looking is, in Chaucer’s
‘Romaunt of the rose,’ described as</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">painted well, and thwitten<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over all diapred and written, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>So now, we call our fine table linen “diaper” because it is
figured with flowers and fruits. Sometimes silks diapered were
called “fygury:” as the cope mentioned in the York fabric rolls,
“una capa de sateyn fygury.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">There</span> are some very ancient names, distinguishing different
textiles, which require notice: such as “chrysoclavus,” “stauraccin,”
“polystaurium,” “gammadion” or “gammadiæ,” “de
quadruplo,” “de octoplo,” and “de fundato.” Textiles of silk and
gold are, over and over again, enumerated as then commonly
known under such names, in the ‘Liber pontificalis seu de gestis
Romanorum pontificum:’ a book of great value for every student
of early Christian art-work, and in particular of textiles and embroidery.</p>

<p>The <i>Chrysoclavus</i>, or golden nail-head, was a remnant which
lingered a long time among the ornaments embroidered on ecclesiastical
vestments and robes for royal wear of that once so
coveted “latus clavus,” or broad nail-head-like purple round
patch worn upon the outward garment of the old Roman dignitaries.
In the court of Byzantium this mark of dignity was
elevated, from being purple on white, into gold upon purple.
Hence it came that all rich purple silks, woven or embroidered
with the “clavus” in gold, were known from their pattern as gold
nail-headed, or chrysoclavus; and silken textiles of Tyrian dye,
sprinkled all over with large round spots, were once in great
demand. Pope Leo in 795, among his several other gifts to the
churches at Rome, bestowed a great number of altar frontals
made of this purple and gold fabric, as we are told by Anastasius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
in the Liber pontificalis. Sometimes these “clavi” were made so
large that upon their golden ground an event in the life of a saint
or the saint’s head was embroidered, and then the whole piece
was called “sigillata,” or <i>sealed</i>.</p>

<p><i>Stauracin</i> or “stauracinus,” taking its name from σταυρὸς
the Greek for “cross,” was a silken stuff figured with small plain
crosses, and therefore from their number sometimes farther distinguished
by the word signifying that meaning in Greek, <i>Polystauron</i>.</p>

<p>The crosses woven on the various fabrics were sometimes of
the simplest shape; oftener they were designed after an elaborate
type with a symbolic meaning about it that afforded an especial
name to the stuffs upon which they were figured.</p>

<p>This name <i>Gammadion</i>, or <i>Gammadiæ</i>, was a word applied as
often to the pattern upon silks as to the figures wrought upon
gold and silver.</p>

<p>In the Greek alphabet the capital letter gamma takes the
shape of an exact right angle thus, Γ. Being so, many writers
have seen in it an emblem of our Lord as our corner-stone.
Following this idea artists at a very early period struck out a way
of forming the cross after several shapes by various combinations
with it of this letter Γ. Four of these gammas put so;</p>

<div id="ip_36" class="figcenter tight" style="max-width: 4em;">
  <img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="54" height="49" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">fall into the shape of the so-called Greek cross; and in this form it
was woven upon the textiles denominated <i>stauracinæ</i>; or patterned
with a cross. Being one of the four same-shaped elements
of the cross’s figure, the part was significant of the whole: and as
an emblem of the corner-stone, our Lord, the gamma or Γ, was
frequently shown at one edge of the tunic worn by the apostles
in ancient mosaics; wherein sometimes we find, in place of the
single gamma, the figure H; another combination of the four
gammas in the cross. Whatsoever, therefore, whether of metal
or of silk, was found to be marked in this or any other way of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
putting the gammas together, or with only a single one, was
called “gammadion,” or “gammadiæ.”</p>

<p>Ancient ingenuity for throwing its favourite gamma into other
combinations, and thus bringing out pretty and graceful patterns to
be wrought on all sorts of work for ecclesiastical use, did not stop
here. In the Liber pontificalis of Anastasius we meet not unfrequently
with accounts of vestments, etc. “de stauracin seu quadrapolis”;
or “de quadrapolo”; or “de octapolo.” The author here
evidently means to imply a distinction between a something amounting
to four, and to eight, in or upon these textiles. It cannot be to
say that one fabric was woven with four, the other with eight
threads; had that been so meant, the fact would probably then have
been explained by a word constructed like “examitus,” p. 24. As
the contrast is not in the texture it must be in the pattern of the
stuffs; that is, in the number of the crosses: and we further
see why “stauracin” and “de quadrapolis” are interchangeable
terms.</p>

<p>At the end of Du Cange’s glossary is an engraving of a
work of Greek art; plate IX. Here St. John Chrysostom stands
between St. Nicholas and St. Basil. All three are arrayed in their
liturgical garments, which being figured with crosses are of the
textile called of old “stauracin;” but there is a marked difference
in the way in which the crosses are inserted. The crosses are
arranged upon the vestment of St. John thus;</p>

<div id="ip_37" class="figcenter tight" style="max-width: 7em;">
  <img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="112" height="62" alt="" /></div>

<p class="in0">St. Nicholas and St. Basil have chasubles which are not only worked
all over with crosses made with gammas, but are surrounded with
other gammas joined so as to edge in the crosses, thus;</p>

<div id="ip_37b" class="figcenter tight" style="max-width: 5em;">
  <img src="images/i_037b.jpg" width="76" height="71" alt="" /></div>

<p>As four gammas only are necessary to form all the crosses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
upon St. John’s vestment, we there see the textile called “stauracin
de quadruplo,” or the stuff figured with a cross of four
(gammas); while as eight of these letters are required for the
pattern on the others, we have in them an example of the “stauracin
de octapolo,” or “octapulo,” a fabric with a pattern composed
of eight gammas.</p>

<p>A far more ancient and universal shape fashioned out of the
repetition of the same letter Γ, is that known as <i>Gammadion</i>; or,
as commonly called at one time in England, the <i>Filfot</i>. Several
pieces in the South Kensington collection exhibit on them some
modification of it: for example, nos. 1261, 1325, 7052, 829<span class="smcap smaller">A</span>,
8305, 8635, and 8652. Its figure is made out of the usual four
gammas, so that they should fall together thus;</p>

<div id="ip_38" class="figcenter tight" style="max-width: 3em;">
  <img src="images/i_038.jpg" width="42" height="44" alt="" /></div>

<p>Of silks patterned with the plain Greek cross or “stauracin”
there are also several examples in the same collection; and though
not of the remotest period are interesting. No. 8234, perhaps
wrought in Sicily by the Greeks brought as prisoners from the Morea
in the twelfth century, is not without some value. In the chapter
library at Durham may be seen (as we learn from Mr. Raine) an
example of Byzantine stauracin “colours purple and crimson; the
only prominent ornament a cross—often repeated, even upon the
small portion which remains.” Those who have seen in St.
Peter’s sacristy at Rome that beautiful light-blue dalmatic said to
have been worn by Charlemagne when he sang the gospel, vested
as a deacon, on the day he was crowned emperor, will remember
how plentifully it is sprinkled with crosses between its exquisite
embroideries, so as to make the vestment a real “stauracin.” It
has been well given by Sulpiz Boisserée in his ‘Kaiser dalmatika
in der St. Peterskirche;’ but far better by Dr. Bock in his splendid
work on the coronation robes of the German emperors.</p>

<p>Silks called <i>de fundato</i>, from the pattern woven on them, are
frequently spoken of by Anastasius. From the text of that writer,
and from passages in other authors of his time, it would seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
that the silks themselves were dyed of the richest purple and
figured with gold in the pattern of netting. As one of the meanings
for the word “funda” is a fisherman’s net, rich textiles so
figured in gold were denominated “de fundato” or netted. We
gather also from Fortunatus that the costly purple-dyed silks
called “blatta” were always interwoven with gold. This net-pattern
lingered long and, no doubt, we find it under a new name
“laqueatus”—meshed—upon a cope belonging to the church of St.
Paul’s, London, 1295: where an inventory, printed by Dugdale,
includes a cope of baudekin with fir-cones “in campis laqueatis.”
Modifications of this very old pattern may be seen at South
Kensington, nos. 1264, 1266, and 8234. In the diapered pattern
on some of the cloth of gold found lately in the grave of an archbishop,
buried at York about the end of the thirteenth century,
the same netting is discernible.</p>

<p><i>Stragulatæ</i>, striped or barred silks, were at one time in much
request. Frequent mention is made of them in the Exeter inventories;
for example, in 1277, there were two palls of baudekin,
one “stragulata.” The illuminations in the manuscript in the
Harley collection at the British museum of the deposition of
Richard the second affords us instances of this textile. The
young man to the right sitting on the ground at the archbishop’s
sermon is entirely, hood and all, arrayed in this striped silk; and
at the altar, where Northumberland is swearing on the eucharist,
the priest who is saying mass wears a chasuble of the same stuff.
Old St. Paul’s had an offertory-veil of the same pattern; “stragulatum”
with the stripes red and green.</p>

<p>At the end of the twelfth century there was brought to England,
from Greece, a sort of precious silk named there <i>Imperial</i>.</p>

<p>Ralph, dean of St Paul’s cathedral, tells us that William de
Magna Villa, on coming home from his pilgrimage to the holy
land about 1178, made presents to several churches of cloths
which at Constantinople were called “Imperial.” We are told by
Roger Wendover, and after him by Matthew Paris, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
apparition of king John was dressed in royal robes made of the
stuff they call imperial. In the inventory of St. Paul’s, drawn up
in 1295, four tunicles (vestments for subdeacons and lower
ministers at the altar) are mentioned as made of this imperial.
No colour is specified, except in the one instance of the silk being
marbled; and the patterns are noticed as of red and green, with
lions woven in gold. It seems not to have been thought good
enough for the more important vestments, such as chasubles and
copes. Probably the name was not derived from its colour (supposed
royal purple) nor its costliness, but for quite another
reason: woven at a workshop kept up by the Byzantine emperors,
like the Gobelins is to-day in Paris, and bearing about it some
small though noticeable mark, it took the designation of “Imperial.”
We know it was partly wrought with gold; but that its
tint was always some shade of the imperial purple is a gratuitous
assumption. In France this textile was in use as late as the
second half of the fifteenth century, but looked upon as old. At
York somewhat later, in the early part of the sixteenth, one of its
deans bestowed on that cathedral “two (blue) copes of clothe
imperialle.”</p>

<p><i>Baudekin</i> was a costly stuff much employed and often spoken
of in our literature during many years of the mediæval period.</p>

<p>Ciclatoun, as we have already remarked, was the usual term
during centuries throughout western Europe by which the showy
golden textiles were called. When, however, Bagdad or Baldak
held for no short length of time the lead all over Asia in weaving
fine silks, and in especial golden stuffs shot as now in different
colours, tinted cloths of gold became known, and more particularly
among the English, as “baldakin,” “baudekin,” or “baudkyn,”
or silks from Baldak. At last the earlier term “ciclatoun”
dropped out of use. Remembering this the reader will more
readily understand several otherwise puzzling passages in our old
writers, as well as in the inventories of royal furniture and church
vestments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
Kings and the nobility affected much this rich stuff for the
garments worn on high occasions. When Henry the third
knighted William of Valence, in 1247, he had on a robe of cloth
of gold made of baudekin; “facta de pretiosissimo baldekino.”
In the year 1259 the master of Sherborn hospital in the north
bequeathed to that house a cope made of the like stuff: “de
panno ad aurum scilicet baudekin.” Vestments of this material
are frequently mentioned in the old church inventories.</p>

<p>These Bagdad or Baldak silks, with a weft of gold, known
among us as “baudekins” were often woven very large in size, and
applied here in England to especial ritual purposes. As a thanks-offering
after a safe return home from a journey they were
brought and given to the altar; at the solemn burial of our kings
and queens and other great people, the mourners, when offertory
time came, went to the hearse and threw a baudekin of costly
texture over the coffin. We may learn the ceremonial from the
descriptions of many of our mediæval funerals. At the obsequies
of Henry the seventh in Westminster abbey:—“Twoe herauds
came to the duke of Buck. and to the earles, and conveyed them
into the revestrie where they did receive certen palles which
everie of them did bringe solemly betwene theire hands and comminge
in order one before another as they were in degree unto
the said herse, thay kissed theire said palles and delivered them
unto the said heraudes which laide them uppon the kyngs corps,
in this manner: the palle which was first offered by the duke
of Buck. was laid on length on the said corps, and the residewe
were laid acrosse, as thick as they might lie.” In the same
church at the burial of Anne of Cleves in 1557, a like
ceremonial of carrying cloth-of-gold palls to the hearse was
followed. So also the religious guilds, or other companies, in the
middle ages kept palls to be thrown over the bodies of all brothers
or sisters at their burial, however lowly may have been their rank.</p>

<p>The word “baudekin” itself became at last enlarged in its
meaning. So warm, so mellow, so fast were the tones of crimson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
which the dyers of Bagdad knew how to give their silks that,
without a thread of gold in them, the mere glowing tints of the
plain crimson silken webs won for themselves the name of baudekins.
Furthermore, when they quite ceased to be partly woven
in gold and from their consequent lower price and cheapness
came into use for cloths of estate over royal thrones, the canopy
hung over the high altar of a church acquired and yet keeps
the appellation (at least in Italy) of “baldachino.”</p>

<p>How very full in size, how costly in materials and embroidery,
must have sometimes been the cloth of estate spread overhead
and behind the throne of our kings, may be gathered from the
privy purse expenses of Henry the seventh; wherein this item
occurs: “To Antony Corsse for a cloth of an estate conteyning
47½ yerds, £11 the yerd, £522 10<i>s.</i>” Canopies of this kind are
still occasionally to be seen in the throne-room of some of the
Roman palaces, whose owners have the old feudal right to the
cloth of estate.</p>

<p>The custom itself is thus noticed by Chaucer:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet nere and nere forth in I gan me dress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into an hall of noble apparaile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With arras spred, and cloth of gold I gesse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other silke of easier availe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the cloth of their estate sauns faile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king and quene there sat as I beheld.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This same rich golden stuff had a third and even better
known name, to be found all through our early literature as <i>Cloth
of Pall</i>.</p>

<p>The state cloak (in Latin pallium, in Anglo-saxon paell),
worn alike by men as well as women, was always made of the
most gorgeous stuff that could be found. From a very early
period in the mediæval ages golden webs shot in silk with one or
other of the various colours, occasionally blue but oftener crimson,
were sought for through so many years, and everywhere, that
at last each sort of cloth of gold had given to it the name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
“pall,” no matter the immediate purpose to which it might have
to be applied or after what fashion. Vestments for sacred use
and garments for knights and ladies were equally made of it.
The word is common enough in the church inventories.</p>

<p>As to worldly use, the king’s daughter in the ‘Squire of low
degree’ had</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mantell of ryche degre<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Knights her served, at hand and feet<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>For ceremonial receptions our kings used to order that every
house should be “curtained” along the streets which the procession
would have to take through London, “incortinaretur.”
How this was done we learn from Chaucer in the ‘Knight’s
tale’;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

</div>

<p class="in0">Hence, when Elizabeth, queen of Henry the seventh, “proceeded
from the towre throwge the citie of London (for her coronation)
to Westminster, al the strets ther wich she shulde passe by, were
clenly dressed and besene with clothes of tappestreye and arras.
And some strets, as Cheepe, hangged with rich clothes of gold,
velvetts, and silks, etc.” Machyn in his diary tells us that as
late as 1555 “Bow chyrche in London was hangyd with cloth of
gold and with ryche hares (arras).”</p>

<p>Both in England and abroad, it was customary in the middle
ages to provide richly decorated palls with which to cover the
biers of dead people: more especially the members of various
guilds. Some of these are still existing; one, belonging to the<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_44">44</a><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
London fishmongers’ company; another, of the fifteenth century,
is in the museum at Amiens.</p>

<p>A celebrated Mohammedan writer, Ebn-Khaldoun, who died
about the middle of the fifteenth century, while speaking of
that spot in an Arab palace, the “Tiraz,” so designated from
the name itself of the rich silken stuffs therein woven, tells us
that one of the privileges of the Saracenic kings was to have
the name of the prince himself, or the special ensign chosen
by his house, woven into the stuffs intended for his personal
wear, whether wrought of silk, brocade, or even coarser kind of
silk. While gearing his loom the workman contrived that the
letters of the title should come out either in threads of gold,
or in silk of another colour from that of the ground. The
royal apparel thus bore about it its own especial marks, and
distinguished not only the sovereign but those personages
around him who were allowed by their official rank in his
court to wear it; or those again upon whom he had bestowed
rich garments as especial tokens of the imperial favour, like
the modern pelisse of honour. Before the time of Mahomet
the eastern princes used to have woven upon the stuffs wrought
for their personal use, or as gifts to others, their own especial
likeness, or at times the peculiar ensign of their royalty. But
afterwards the custom was changed and names were substituted,
to which words were added foreboding good or certain formulas
of praise. Wherever the Moslem ruled the practice was introduced;
and thus, whether in Asia, in Egypt, or other parts of
Africa, or in Moorish Spain, the silken garments for royalty
and its favourites showed woven in them the prince’s name,
or his chosen text. The robes wrought in Egypt for the far-famed
Saladin, and worn by him as caliph, bore very conspicuously
upon them the name of that conqueror.</p>

<p>In the old lists of church ornaments frequent mention is
found of vestments inscribed with words in real or pretended
Arabic; and when St. Paul’s inventory more than once speaks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
of silken stuffs “de opere Saraceno” it is not improbable that
some at least of those textiles were so called from having
Arabic characters woven on them. Such, too, were the letters
on the red pall figured with elephants and a bird, belonging in
the fourteenth century to the cathedral at Exeter. Somewhat
later, our trade with the south of Spain led us to call such
words on woven stuffs Moorish: thus, Joane lady Bergavenny
bequeaths (1434) a “hullyng (hangings for a hall) of black
red and green, with morys letters, etc.”</p>

<div id="ip_46" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 21em;">
  <img src="images/i_046.jpg" width="333" height="404" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Silk damask (Sicilian) with imitated Arabic letters.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
The weaving of letters in textiles is neither a Moorish nor
Saracenic invention; ages before, the ancient Parthians used to
do so, as we learn from Pliny: “Parthi literas vestibus intexunt.”
A curious illustration of the frequent use of silken stuffs bearing
letters, borrowed from some real or supposed oriental alphabet,
is the custom which many of the illuminators had of figuring on
frontals and altar canopies, evidently intended to represent silk,
meaningless words; and the artists of Italy up to the middle
of the sixteenth century did the same on the hems of the
garments worn by great personages, in their paintings.</p>

<p>The eagle, single and double-headed, may frequently be
found in the patterns of old silks. In all ages certain birds of
prey have been looked upon by heathens as ominous for good
or evil. Upon the standard which was carried at the head of
the Danish invaders of Northumbria was figured the raven, the
bird of Odin. This banner had been worked by the daughters
of Regnar Lodbrok, in one noontide’s while; and it is recorded
by Asser that if victory was to follow, the raven would
seem to stand erect and as if about to soar before the warriors;
but if a defeat was impending, the raven hung his head and
drooped his wings. Another and a more important flag, that
which Harold fought under at Hastings, is described by
Malmesbury as having been embroidered in gold with the figure
of a man in the act of fighting, and studded with precious
stones, woven sumptuously.</p>

<p>In still earlier ages the eagle, known for its daring and its
lofty flight, was held in high repute; as the emblem of power
and victory it is to be seen flying in triumph over the head
of some Assyrian conqueror, as may be witnessed in Layard’s
work on Nineveh. Homer calls it the bird of Jove. Quintus
Curtius says that a golden eagle was carved upon the yoke of
the war chariot of king Darius, as if outstretching his wings.
The Romans bore the bird upon their standards; the Byzantine
emperors kept it as their device; and, following the ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
traditions of the east and heedless of their law that forbids the
making of images, the Saracens, especially when they ruled in
Egypt, had the eagle figured on several things about them, sometimes
single at others double-headed, which latter was the
shape adopted by the emperors of Germany as their blazon; in
which form it is borne to this day by several reigning houses.
It is not strange, therefore, that eagles of both fashions are so
often to be observed woven upon ancient and eastern textiles.</p>

<p>As early as 1277 Exeter cathedral reckoned among her
vestments several so decorated; for instance, a cope of baudekin
figured with small two-headed eagles: and Richard king
of Germany, brother of Henry the third of England, gave to
the same church a cope of black baudekin with eagles in gold
figured on it. These are recorded in the inventories printed by
Dr. Oliver; and many like instances might be noticed in other
lists.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Hitherto</span> no attempt has been made to distribute olden silken
textiles into various schools; but the numerous specimens in the
admirable collection at South Kensington enable us to separate
them into several groups—Chinese, Persian, Byzantine, Indian,
Syrian, Saracenic, Moresco-Spanish, Sicilian, Italian, Flemish,
British, and French. We shall now especially refer to that
collection.</p>

<p>The Chinese examples are not many: but, whether plain or
figured, they are beautiful in their own way. From all that we
know of the people, we are led to believe that their style two
thousand years ago is the same still; so that the web wrought by
them this year or three hundred years ago, like no. 1368, would differ
hardly in a line from their far earlier textiles; of which Dionysius
Periegetes wrote that “the Seres make precious figured garments,
resembling in colour the flowers of the field, and rivalling in fineness
the work of spiders.” In these stuffs, warp and woof are of
silk and both of the best kinds.</p>

<p>Persian textiles, as we see them at South Kensington, must
also have been for many centuries very much the same in design
and character. Sometimes the design is made up of various kinds
of beasts and birds, real or imaginary, with the sporting cheetah
spotted among them; and the “homa” or tree of life conspicuously
set above all. In such cases we may conclude that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
web was wrought by Persians, and generally the textile will be
found in all its parts to be of the richest materials.</p>

<p>No. 8233, may be referred to as an illustration of the Persian
type.</p>

<p>A school of design sprung up among the Byzantine Greeks,
from the time when in the sixth century they began to weave
home-grown silk, which retained not a little of the beauty, breadth,
and flowing outline of ancient art. Together with this, a strong
feeling of Christianity showed itself as well in many of the
subjects which they took out of holy writ as in the smaller
elements of ornamentation. Figures, whether of the human form
or of beasts, are given in a much larger and bolder size than on
any other ancient stuffs. Though there are not many known
specimens from the old looms of Constantinople there is one,
no. 7036, showing Samson wrestling with a lion, which may serve
as a type. In the year 1295 St. Paul’s cathedral would seem to
have possessed several vestments made of Byzantine silk. A
very splendid dalmatic of Byzantine silk, probably of the twelfth
century, is preserved in the treasury of St. Peter’s at Rome. The
colour is dark blue, and the embroidery in gold and colours.</p>

<p>The specimens at South Kensington from the Byzantine and
later Greek loom are not to be taken as by any means first-rate
examples of its general production. They are poor both in
material and, when figured, in design. There are, however, many
pieces: nos. 1241, 1246, 1257, 1266, etc.</p>

<p>Indian ancient silks and textiles have their own distinctive
marks.</p>

<p>From Marco Polo, who wandered much over the far east some
time during the thirteenth century, we learn that the weaving in
India was done by women who wrought in silk and gold, after a
noble manner, beasts and birds upon their webs:—“Le loro
donne lavorano tutte cose a seta e ad oro e a uccelli e a bestie
nobilmente e lavorano di cortine ed altre cose molto ricamente.”</p>

<div id="ip_51" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="475" height="535" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Byzantine Dalmatic: preserved at Rome.</div></div>

<p>Several of the South Kensington mediæval specimens from<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_51">51</a><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Tartary and India show well the truthfulness of the great Venetian
traveller, while speaking about the textiles which he saw in those
countries. The dark purple piece of silk figured in gold with birds
and beasts of the thirteenth century, no. 7086, is good; but
better still is the shred of blue damask, no. 7087, with its birds,
its animals, and flowers wrought in gold and different coloured
silks. India, also, has ever been famous for its cloud-like
transparent muslins, which since Marco Polo’s days have kept
that oriental name, through being better woven at Mosul than
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Syrian school is well represented at South Kensington by
several fine pieces.</p>

<p>The whole sea-board of that part of Asia minor, as well as far
inland, was inhabited by a mixture of Jews, Christians, and
Saracens; and all were workers in silk. The reputation of the
neighbouring Persia had of old stood high for the beauty and
durability of her silken textiles, which caused them to be sought for
by the European traders. Persia’s outlet to the west for her goods
lay through the great commercial ports on the coast of Syria.
Persia was accustomed to set her own peculiar seal upon her
figured webs, by mingling in her designs the mystic “homa:”
and, naturally, this part of the pattern became in the eyes of
Europeans, at first, a sort of assurance that those goods had been
made in Persian looms. By one of the tricks of imitation followed
in that day, as well as now, the Syrian designers threw the
“homa” into their patterns. Borrowed perhaps originally from
Hebrew tradition, this symbol of “the tree of life” had in it
nothing objectionable either to the Christian, the Jew, or the
Moslem: all three, therefore, took it and made it a leading
portion of design in the patterns of their silks; and hence it is
that we meet with it so often. Though at the beginning, it may be,
done with a fraudulent intention of palming on the world Syrian
for Persian silks, the Syrians usually put also into their fabrics a
something which declared the real workmanship. Mixed with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
“homa,” the “cheetah,” and other elements of Persian patterns,
the discordant two-handled vase or the badly-imitated Arabic
sentence betrays the textile to be not Persian but Syrian. No.
8359 exemplifies this. Furthermore, probably in ignorance about
Persia’s superstitious use of the “homa” in her old religious
services, the Christian weavers of Syria put the sign of the cross
by the side of the “tree of life:” as we find upon the piece of
silk, no. 7094. Another remarkable specimen of the Syrian loom
is no. 7034, whereon the Nineveh lions come forth conspicuously.
As good examples of well-wrought “diaspron” or diaper,
no. 8233 and no. 7052 may be mentioned.</p>

<p>Saracenic weaving, as shown by the design upon the web, is
exemplified in several specimens at South Kensington.</p>

<p>However much against what looks like a heedlessness of the
teaching of the Koran, it is certain that the Saracens, those of the
upper classes in particular, felt no difficulty in wearing robes upon
which animals and the likenesses of created things were woven;
with the strictest of their princes a double-headed eagle, possibly
borrowed from the crusaders, was a royal heraldic device. Stuffs
figured with birds and beasts, with trees and flowers, were not the
less on that account of Saracenic workmanship, and meant for
Moslem wear. What, however, may be chiefly looked for upon
Saracenic textures is a pattern consisting of longitudinal stripes
of blue, red, green, and other colour; some of them charged with
animals, small in form; some written, in large Arabic letters, with
a word or sentence.</p>

<p>Moresco-Spanish or Saracenic textiles wrought in Spain, though
partaking of the striped pattern and bearing words in real or
imitated Arabic, had some distinctions of their own. The designs
shown upon these stuffs are almost always drawn out of strap-work,
reticulations, or some combination of geometrical lines,
amid which are occasionally to be found different forms of conventional
flowers. Sometimes, but very rarely, the crescent moon is
figured as in the curious piece, no. 8639. The colours of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
silks are usually either a fine crimson or a deep blue with almost
always a fine toned yellow as a ground. But one remarkable
feature in these Moresco-Spanish textiles is the presence of the
ingenious imitation (before spoken of) of gold; for which shreds
of gilded parchment cut up into narrow flat strips are substituted
and woven with the silk. This, when fresh, must have looked
very bright, and have given the web all the appearance of the
favourite stuffs called here in England “tissues.” The fraud, as
already explained, if fraud it were, is not easily discovered
without a magnifying glass. A guide may be found in the
blackness of the gold. Nos. 7095, 8590, and 8639, are
examples of this gilded vellum.</p>

<p>The Sicilian school strongly marked wide differences between
itself and all the others which had lived before; and the history
of its loom is as interesting as it is varied.</p>

<p>The first to teach the natives of Sicily how to rear the silkworm
and spin its silk were, as it would seem, the Mahomedans, who
coming over from Africa brought with them, besides the art of
weaving silken textiles, a knowledge of the fauna of that vast
continent—its giraffes, its antelopes, its gazelles, its lions, its
elephants. These invaders told them also of the parrots of India
and the hunting sort of leopard,—the cheetahs; and when the
stuff was wrought for European wear both beast and bird were
imaged upon the web, and at the same time a word in Arabic was
woven in. Like all other Saracens, those in Sicily loved to mingle
gold in their tissues; and, to spare the silk, cotton thread was
not unfrequently worked up in the warp. When, therefore, we
meet with beasts taken from the fauna of Africa, such, especially,
as the giraffe and the several classes of the antelope family, with
perhaps also an Arabic motto, and part of the pattern wrought in
gold, as well as cotton in the warp, we may fairly take the specimen
as a piece of Sicily’s work in its first period of weaving silk.</p>

<p>The second epoch was when in the twelfth century Roger,
king of Sicily, took Corinth, Thebes, and Athens; from each of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
which cities he led away captives all the men and women he could
find who knew how to weave silks, and carried them to Palermo.
These Grecian new comers brought fresh designs which were
adopted sometimes wholly, at others but in part and mixed up
with the older Saracenic style. In this second period of the
island’s loom we discover what traces the Byzantine school impressed
upon Sicilian silks, and helped so much to alter the type
of their first designs. On one silk, the pattern is a grotesque
mask amid the graceful twinings of luxuriant foliage, such as might
have been then found upon many a fragment of old Greek sculpture;
this may be seen on no. 8241; on another, a sovereign on horseback
wearing the royal crown and carrying a hawk upon his
wrist, as in no. 8589; on a third, no. 8234, is the Greek cross,
with a pattern much like the old netted or “de fundato” kind
which has been described, p. 38.</p>

<p>But Sicily’s third is quite her own peculiar style. At the end
of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century she
struck into an untried path. Without throwing aside the old
elements employed by the Mahomedans Sicily put with them the
emblem of Christianity, the cross, in various forms, on some
occasions with the letter V. four times repeated.</p>

<p>From the east to the uttermost western borders of the
Mediterranean the weavers of every country had been in the
habit of figuring upon their silks those beasts and birds they saw
around them: the Tartar, the Indian, and the Persian gave us the
parrot and the cheetah; the Africans, the giraffe and the gazelle;
the people of each continent, the lions, the elephants, the eagles,
and the other birds common to both. From the sculpture of the
Greeks and Romans the Sicilians could have easily copied the
fabled griffin and the centaur; but it was left for their own wild
imaginings to figure such an odd compound in one being as the
animal—half elephant, half griffin—which we see in no. 1288.
Their daring flights of fancy in coupling the difficult with the
beautiful are curious; in one piece large eagles are perched in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
pairs with a radiating sun between them, and beneath are dogs,
in pairs, running with heads turned back; in another, running
harts have caught one of their hind legs in a cord tied to their
collar, and an eagle swoops down upon them; and the same
animal, in another place on the same piece, has switched its tail
into the last link of a chain fastened to its neck; on a third
sample are harts, the letter M floriated, winged lions, crosses
floriated, crosses sprouting out on two sides with <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>, and
four-legged monsters, some like winged lions, some biting their
tails. Hardly elsewhere to be found are certain elements peculiar
to the patterns upon silks from mediæval Sicily; such, for
instance, as harts, and demi-dogs with very large wings, both
animals having remarkably long manes streaming far behind them;
or harts lodged under green trees in a park with paling about it.
The hawk, the eagle, double and single headed, or the parrot,
may be found on stuffs all over the east; not so, however, the
swan, which was a favourite with Sicilians and may be seen often
drawn with much gracefulness.</p>

<p>The Sicilians showed their strong affection for certain plants
and flowers. On a great many of the silks in the South Kensington
collection from Palermitan looms we see figured upon a
tawny coloured grounding beautifully drawn foliage in green;
sometimes vine leaves, sometimes what looks like parsley, so
curled, crispy, and serrated are its leaves. Another peculiarity
is the introduction of the letter U, repeated so as to mark the
feathering upon the tails of birds; or to fall into the shape of an
O; as in nos. 8591, 8599.</p>

<p>Whether it was that the crusaders made Sicily so often the
halting spot on their way to the holy land, or that knights
crowded there for other purposes, and thus dazzled the eyes of the
islanders with the bravery of their armorial bearings, it is certain
that the Sicilians were particularly given to introduce many
heraldic charges—wyverns, eagles, lions rampant, and griffins—into
their designs. The occasions in which such elements of<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_57">57</a><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
blazoning come in are so numerous that one of the features
belonging to the Sicilian loom in its third period is that, bating
tinctures, it is decidedly heraldic.</p>

  <div class="caption">Silk damask—Sicilian: fourteenth century.</div></div>

<p>All this beauty and happiness of invention, set forth by bold,
free, spirited drawing, were bestowed too often upon stuffs of a
very poor inferior quality, in which the gold if not actually base
was always scanty, and a good deal of cotton was wrought up with
the silk.</p>

<p>Till within a few years past the royal manufactory at Sta.
Leucia, near Naples, produced silks of remarkable richness; and
the piece, no. 721, does credit to its loom, as it wove in the seventeenth
century. Northern Italy was not idle; and the looms
which she set up in several of her great cities, in Lucca, Florence,
Genoa, Venice, and Milan, earned for themselves a good repute
and a wide trade for their gold and silver tissues, their velvets,
and their figured silken textiles. Yet, in the same way as each
of these free states had its own accent and provincialisms in
speech, so also had it a something often thrown into its designs
and style of drawing which told of the place and province whence
the textiles came.</p>

<p>Lucca at an early period made herself known in Europe for
her textiles; but her workmen, like those of Sicily, seem to have
thought themselves bound to follow the style brought by the
Saracens of figuring parrots and peacocks, gazelles, and even
cheetahs, as we see in the specimens no. 8258 and no. 8616.
But with these eastern animals she mixed up emblems of her own,
such as angels clothed in white. She soon dropped what was
oriental from her patterns which she began to draw in a larger,
bolder manner, and showing an inclination for light blue as a
colour.</p>

<p>As in other places abroad so at Lucca cloths of gold and of
silver were often wrought, and the Lucchese cloths of this costly
sort were in much request in England during the fourteenth century.
In all likelihood they were not of the deadened but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
sparkling kind, afterwards especially known as “tissue.” Exeter
cathedral, in 1327, had a cope of silver tissue, or cloth of Lucca:—“de
panno de Luk.” At a later date, belonging to the same
church, were two fine chasubles—one purple, the other red—of the
same glittering stuff: “de purpyll panno.” York cathedral possessed
many copes of tissue shot with every colour required by
its ritual, and among them were “a reade cope of clothe of tishewe
with orphry of pearl, a cope with orphrey, a cope of raised clothe
of goulde,” making a distinction between tissue and the ordinary
cloth of gold. In the wardrobe accounts of Edward the second
the golden tissue, or Lucca cloth, is several times mentioned.
Whether the ceremony happened to be sad or gay this glittering
web was used; palls made of Lucca cloth were, at masses for the
dead, strewed over the corpse; at marriages the care-cloth was
made of the same stuff: thus when Richard de Arundell and
Isabella, Hugh le Despenser’s daughter, had been wedded at the
door of the royal chapel, the veil held spread out over their heads
as they knelt inside the chancel during the nuptial mass was of
Lucca cloth.</p>

<p>About the same time velvet became known, and came into use
both for vestments and for personal wear; and Lucca probably
was among the first places in Europe to weave it. The specimens
at South Kensington of this fine textile from Lucchese looms,
though few in comparison with those from Genoa, still have a
certain historical value for the English workman: no. 1357, with
its olive green plain silken ground and trailed all over with
flowers and leaves in a somewhat deeper tone, and the earlier
example, no. 8322, with its ovals and feathering stopped with
graceful cusps and artichokes, afford us good instances of what
Lucca could produce in the way of artistic velvets.</p>

<p>Genoa, though in mediæval times not so conspicuous as she
afterwards became for her textile industry, encouraged over her
narrow territory the weaving of silken webs. Of these the earliest
mention we have found is in the inventory of vestments belonging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
to St. Paul’s cathedral, London, in 1295: besides a cope of Genoa
cloth that church had, of the same manufacture, a hanging patterned
with wheels and two-headed birds. Though this first
description be scant, we may reasonably gather that the Genoese
cloths must have resembled the textiles wrought at Lucca. Genoa
still keeps up her old reputation for beautiful velvets.</p>

<p>In the collection at South Kensington there are examples of
every kind of Genoese velvets; some with a smooth unbroken
surface, some elaborately patterned and showing, together with
wonderful skill in the weaving, much beauty of design. Some
are raised or cut, the design being worked in a pile standing well
up by itself out of a flat ground of silk, either of the same or
of another colour, and not unfrequently wrought in gold. No.
7795 is an example of a very costly kind; in which the ground is
velvet, and again of velvet is the pattern itself but raised one pile
higher than the other, so as to show its form and shape distinctly.
No. 8323 shows how the design was worked in various coloured
velvet. This last was a favourite in England and called motley;
in his will, 1415, printed in Rymers Fœdera, Henry lord Scrope
bequeathed two vestments, one, motley velvet rubeo de auro; the
other, motley velvet nigro, rubeo et viridi, etc.</p>

<p>Venice does not seem to have been at any time, like Sicily and
Lucca, smitten with the taste of imitating in her looms the patterns
which she saw abroad upon textile fabrics, but appears to have
borrowed from the orientals only one kind of weaving cloth of
gold: the yellow chasuble at Exeter cathedral in 1327, figured
with beasts, is the only instance we know where she wove animals
upon silks. Venice, however, set up for herself a new branch of
textiles, and wrought for church use square webs of a crimson
ground on which were figured, in gold or on yellow silk, subjects
taken from the Scriptures or the persons of saints and angels.
These square pieces were employed, sewed together, as frontals to
altars, but when longwise more generally as orphreys to chasubles,
copes, and other vestments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
There is a remarkable similarity between the drawing of the
figures upon old Venetian silks and the woodcuts in books published
at Venice in the early part of the sixteenth century; such
as the fine pontifical by Giunta, or the “Rosario” by Varisco.
We find in both the same style and manner; the same broad fold
and fall of drapery; the same plumpness and outline of the human
face and figure. So near is the likeness in design that we may
almost believe that the artists who supplied the blocks for the
printers sketched also the drawings for the looms.</p>

<p>By the fifteenth century Venice knew how to produce good
damasks in silk and gold: if we had nothing more than the
specimen, no. 1311, where St. Mary of Egypt is so well represented,
it would be quite enough for her to claim for herself such a distinction.
Nor can there be much doubt that Venice wrought in
velvet; and if those rich stuffs were made there, sometimes raised,
sometimes pile upon pile, in which her painters loved to dress the
personages, men especially, in their pictures, then Venetian velvets
were certainly beautiful. Of this any one may satisfy himself by
one visit to our National gallery. There, in the “Adoration of
the magi” painted by Paulo Veronese, the second of the wise men
is clad in a robe of crimson velvet, cut or raised after a design in
keeping with the style of the period.</p>

<p>No insignificant article of Venetian textile workmanship were
her laces wrought in every variety; in gold, in silk, in thread.
The portrait of a Doge usually shows him clothed in his dress of
state. His wide mantle, with large golden buttons, is made of
some rich dull silver cloth; and on his head is the Phrygian-shaped
ducal cap bound round with broad gold lace diapered, as
we see in the bust portrait of Loredano, painted by John Bellini,
in the National gallery. Not only was the gold in the thread
particularly good but the lace itself in great favour at the English
court at one time; bought, not by yard measure but by weight,
“a pounde and a half of gold of Venys” was employed “aboute
the making of a lace and botons for the king’s mantell of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
garter.” This was for Henry the seventh. “Frenge of Venys
gold” appears twice in the wardrobe accounts of Edward the
fourth. Laces in worsted or in linen thread wrought by the
bobbin at Venice, but more especially her point laces or such as
were done with the needle, always had, as they still have, a great
reputation.</p>

<p>Venetian linens, for fine towelling and napery in general, were
in favourite use in France during a part of the fifteenth century.
In the ‘Ducs de Bourgogne’ by Laborde, more than once we
meet with such an entry as “une pièce de nappes, ouvraige de
Venise.”</p>

  <div class="caption">Silk damask—Florentine: fifteenth century.</div></div>

<p>Florence, about the middle of the fourteenth century, obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
a place in the foremost rank amid the weavers of northern Italy.
Specimens of her earliest handicraft are rare; there are two at
South Kensington. One of these, no. 8563, shows the excellence
of her work in secular silks. Other pieces witness to the delicacy
of her design at a later time, the sixteenth century. The orphrey-webs
of Florence are equally conspicuous for drawing and skill in
weaving, and in beauty come up to those made at Venice, far
surpassing anything of the kind ever wrought at Cologne.</p>

<p>But it was of her velvets that Florence was warrantably proud.
Henry the seventh bequeathed “to God and St. Peter, and to the
abbot and prior and convent of our monastery of Westminster, the
whole suit of vestments made at Florence in Italy.” We may yet
see how gorgeous this textile was in one of these Westminster
abbey copes still in existence, preserved at Stonyhurst college.
The golden ground is trailed all over with leaf-bearing boughs of
a bold type, in raised or cut ruby-toned velvet of a rich soft pile,
which is freckled with gold thread sprouting up like loops.
Though not so rich in material nor so splendid in pattern, there
are at South Kensington, nos. 7792 and 7799, two specimens of
Florentine cut crimson velvet on a golden ground, like the royal
vestments in their kind and having the same peculiarity, the little
gold thread loop shooting out of the velvet pile. These pieces are
a full century later than the cope at Stonyhurst.</p>

<p>That peculiar sort of ornamentation—the little loop of gold
thread standing well up and in single spots—upon some velvets,
seems at times to have been replaced, perhaps with the needle, by
small dots of solid metal, gold or silver gilt, upon the pile: of the
gift of one of its bishops, John Grandisson, Exeter cathedral had
a crimson velvet cope, the purple velvet orphrey of which was so
wrought: “purpyll velvette worked with pynsheds” of pure gold.</p>

<p>Milan, though now-a-days she stands in such high repute for
the richness and beauty of her silks of all sorts, was not, we believe,
at any period during mediæval times as famous for her velvets, her
brocades, or cloths of gold, as for her armour, so strong and trustworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
for the field, so exquisitely demascened for courtly service.
Still, in the sixteenth century, she earned a name for rich cut
velvets as may be seen in the specimen, no. 698; for her silken
net-work, no. 8336, which may have led the way to weaving silk
stockings; and for her laces of the open tinsel kind once in great
vogue for both sacred and secular use, as in no. 8331.</p>

<p>England, from her earliest period, had textile fabrics varying in
design and material; the colours in the woollen garments worn by
each of the three several classes into which the Bardic order was
divided, and of the chequered pattern in Boadicea’s cloak, have
been already mentioned. It would seem from John Garland,
whose witness is referred to above, p. 12, that the lighter and more
tasteful webs wrought here came from women’s hands; and the
loom, one of which must have been in almost every English nunnery
and homestead, was of the simplest make.</p>

<p>In ancient times the Egyptians wove in an upright loom, and
beginning at top so as to weave downwards sat at their work.
In Palestine also the weaver had an upright loom, but, beginning
at bottom and working upwards, was obliged to stand. During
the mediæval period the loom in England was horizontal, as is
shown by that figured in the Bedford book of Hours (preserved in
the British museum), fol. 32; at which the blessed Virgin is seated
weaving curtains for the temple.</p>

<p>There are several examples at South Kensington of the work
of English women, showing the excellence of their handicraft as
well as elegance in design during the thirteenth century. Nos.
1233, 1256, and 1270 may be referred to. But for specimens of
the commoner sorts of silken textiles and of wider breadth, which
began to be woven in this country under Edward the third, it would
be hazardous to direct the reader. Recent examples, velvets
among the rest, may be found in the Brooke collection. To some
students the piece of old English printed chintz, no. 1622, will
not be without an interest.</p>

<p>For the finer sort of linen napery Eylisham or Ailesham in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
Lincolnshire was famous during the fourteenth century. Exeter
cathedral, in 1327, had a hand towel of “Ailesham cloth.”</p>

<p>Our coarser native textiles in wool or in thread, or in both
woven together, formed a stuff called “burel.” St. Paul’s in
1295 had a light blue chasuble, and Exeter cathedral in 1277 a
long pall of this texture. Burel and, in short, all the coarser
kinds of work were wrought by men: sometimes in monasteries.
The old Benedictine rule obliged the monks to give a certain
number of hours every week-day to hand-work, either at home or
in the field.</p>

<p>The weaving in this country of woollen cloth, as a staple
branch of trade, is very old. Of the monks at Bath abbey we are
told by a late writer, “that the shuttle and the loom employed
their attention (about the middle of the fourteenth century), and
under their active auspices the weaving of woollen cloth (which
made its appearance in England about the year 1330, and received
the sanction of an act of parliament in 1337) was introduced,
established, and brought to such perfection at Bath as rendered
the city one of the most considerable in the west of England for
this manufacture.” Worcester cloth was so good that, by a chapter
of the Benedictine order held in 1422 at Westminster abbey, it
was forbidden to be worn by the monks and declared smart enough
for military men. Norwich also wove stuffs that were in demand
for costly household furniture; and Sir John Cobham, in 1394,
bequeathed “a bed of Norwich stuff embroidered with butterflies.”
In one of the chapels at Durham priory there were four blue
cushions of Norwich work. Worsted, a town in Norfolk, by a
new method of its own for the carding of the wool with combs of
iron well heated, and then twisting the thread harder than usual in
the spinning, enabled our weavers to produce a woollen stuff of a
peculiar quality, to which the name itself of worsted was immediately
given. To such a high repute did the new web grow that
church vestments and domestic furniture of the choicest sorts were
made out of it. Exeter cathedral among its chasubles had several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
“de nigro worsted” in cloth of gold. Vestments made of worsted,
variously spelt “worsett” and “woryst,” are enumerated in the
fabric rolls of York minster. Elizabeth de Bohun, in 1356, bequeathed
to her daughter the countess of Arundel “a bed of red
worsted embroidered;” and Joane lady Bergavenny leaves to John
of Ormond “a bed of cloth of gold with lebardes, with those
cushions and tapettes of my best red worsted.”</p>

<p>Irish cloth, white and red, in the reign of king John was much
used in England; and in the household expenses of Swinford,
bishop of Hereford in 1290, an item occurs of Irish cloth for
lining.</p>

<p>English weavers knew also how to work artificially designed
and well-figured webs. In the wardrobe accounts of Edward the
second is this item: “to a mercer of London for a green hanging
of wool wove with figures of kings and earls upon it, for the king’s
service in his hall on solemn feasts at London.” Such “salles,”
as they were called in France, and “hullings” or rather “hallings”
the name they went under here, were much valued abroad and in
common use at home. Under the head of “Salles d’Angleterre”
among the articles of costly furniture belonging to Charles the fifth
of France, in 1364, one set of hangings is thus entered: “une
salle d’Angleterre vermeille brodée d’azur, et est la bordeure à
vignettes et le dedens de lyons, d’aigles et de lyepars.” Here in
England, Richard earl of Arundel in 1392 willed to his dear wife
“the hangings of the hall which was lately made in London, of
blue tapestry with red roses with the arms of my sons,” etc.; and
lady Bergavenny, after bequeathing her hullying of black, red, and
green to one friend, left to another her best stained “hall.”</p>

<p>Flemish textiles, at least of the less ambitious kinds such as
napery and woollens, were much esteemed centuries ago; and our
countryman Matthew of Westminster says of Flanders that, made
from the material which we sent her, the wool, she sent us back
precious garments. So important was the supply of wool to the
Flemings in the fourteenth century that the check given to it by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the wars between England and France at that time led to a special
treaty between Edward the third and the burghers of the Flemish
communes under the guidance of James van Artevelde.</p>

<p>Though industrious everywhere within her limits, some of the
towns of Flanders stood foremost for certain kinds of stuff, and
Bruges became in the latter end of the fifteenth century conspicuous
for its silken textiles. The satins of Bruges were used in England
for church garments. Haconbie church, in 1566, had “one white
vestmente of bridges satten repte in peces and a clothe made
thereof to hange before our pulpitt;” and in 1520 York cathedral
had “a vestment of balkyn (baudekin) with a crosse of green satten
in bryges.” Her damasks silks were equally in demand; and
the specimens at South Kensington will interest the student.
Nos. 8318 and 8332 show the ability of the Bruges loom;
while the favourite pattern with the pomegranate in it betrays
the likings of the Spaniards, at that time the rulers of the country,
for this token of their renowned Isabella. No. 8319 is another
sample of Flemish weaving, rich in its gold and full of beauty in
design.</p>

<p>In her velvets Flanders had no need to fear a comparison
with anything of the kind that Italy ever threw off from her
looms, whether at Venice, Florence, or Genoa. Not to name
others one example, with its cloth of gold ground and its pattern
in a dark blue deep-piled velvet, is not surpassed in gorgeousness
even by that splendid stuff from Florence of which the Stonyhurst
cope, just spoken of, was made.</p>

<p>Block-printed linen toward the end of the fourteenth century
was another production of Flanders. Though existing examples
to the eyes of many may look poor or mean, yet to men like
the cotton-printers of Lancashire they will have a strong attraction;
and to the scholar they will be deeply interesting as suggestive
of the art of printing. Such specimens are rare, but it is
likely that England can show in the chapter library at Durham
the earliest sample of the kind as yet known; a fine sheet wrapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
about the body of some old bishop found in a grave opened by
Mr. Raine in 1827, within the cathedral. Several pieces of
ancient silks and English embroidery were found at the same
time.</p>

<p>What Bruges was in silks and velvets, Yprès, in the sixteenth
century, became for linen; and for many years Flemish linens
were in favourite use throughout England. Hardly a church
of any size, scarcely a gentleman’s house in this country, but used
a quantity of towels and other napery that was made in Flanders,
especially at Yprès.</p>

<p>French silks, now in such extensive use, were not much cared
for until the end of the sixteenth century in France itself, and
seldom heard of abroad. The reader, then, must not be astonished
at finding so few examples of the French loom in any
collection of ancient silken textiles.</p>

<p>In France, as in England, women in mediæval days, old and
young, rich and poor, while filling up their leisure hours in-doors
used to work on a small loom, weaving narrow webs, often of
gold and diapered with coloured silks. At South Kensington,
nos. 1250, 7062, and 7064 are examples of such French wrought
stuffs belonging to the thirteenth century. In damasks, the
earliest French productions are of the sixteenth century; and
no. 8352 is a favourable example of what this manufacture then
was in France; everything later is of the type so well known to
everybody. In several of her textiles a leaning towards classicism
in design is discernible.</p>

<p>Like Flanders, France knew how to weave fine linen which
here in England was much employed for ecclesiastical as well
as household purposes. Three new cloths of Rains (Rennes
in Brittany) were, in 1327, in use for the high altar in Exeter
cathedral, and many altar cloths of Paris linen. In the poem of
the ‘Squire of low degree’ the lady is told</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your blankettes shal be of fustyane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your shetes shal be of cloths of rayne;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
and, in 1434, lady Bergavenny devises in her will “two pair
sheets of Raynes, a pair of fustians,” etc.</p>

<p>Cologne, the queen of the Rhine, became famous during the
whole of the fifteenth and part of the sixteenth century for a
certain kind of ecclesiastical textile which, from the very general
use to which it has been applied, we may call “orphrey web.”
The productions of Cologne, however, are every way far below
in beauty the similar works of Italy. Italian orphrey-webs are
generally worked in gold or yellow silk upon a crimson ground of
silk. Florentine are often distinguished from the Venetian by
the introduction of white for the faces; those of Cologne vary
from both by introducing blue, while the material is almost always
poor and the weaving coarse. In England this orphrey web was
in church use and called, as we learn from the York “wills and
testaments,” “rebayn de Colayn.”</p>

<p>The piece of German napery, no. 8317 (of the beginning of
the fifteenth century), will be to those curious about household
linen an acceptable specimen.</p>

<p>If in some old inventory of church vestments we find an entry
mentioning a chasuble made of cloth of Cologne, we should
understand it to mean not a certain broad textile woven there, but
merely a vestment composed of several pieces of this kind of web
sewed together; like the frontal made of pieces of woven Venice
orphreys, no. 8976.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> countries whence silks came to England are numerous; we
find early notices of Antioch, Tarsus, Alexandria, Damascus,
Byzantium, Cyprus, Trip or Tripoli, and Bagdad, and later of
Venice, Genoa, and Lucca. To fix the localities of others would
be but guess work.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fourteenth century a silk called
“<i>Acca</i>” is occasionally mentioned: and, from the description,
it must have been a cloth of gold shot with coloured silk, figured
with animals: William de Clinton, earl of Huntingdon, gave to St.
Alban’s monastery a whole vestment of cloth of gold shot with
sky-blue and called cloth of Acca. It would look as if this stuff
took its name from having been brought to us through the port of
Acre: and Macri, in his valuable Hierolexicon, says that the
name of the ancient Ptolemais in Syria was so written.</p>

<p>What in one age and at a particular place happened to be
well made and therefore was eagerly sought for, at a later period
and in another place was better wrought and at a lower price.
Time, indeed, changed the name of the market, but did not alter
in any great degree either the quality of the material or the style
of the design wrought upon it. Throughout the kingdom of the
Byzantine Greeks the loom had to change its gearing very little.
The Saracenic loom, whether in Asia, Africa, or Spain, was
always Arabic, though Persia could not forget her old traditions
about the “hom” or tree of life, and cheetahs, and birds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
various sorts. With regard to the whole of Asia, its many
peoples from the earliest ages knew how not only to weave cloth
of gold but to figure it with birds and beasts. In later times,
Marco Polo in the thirteenth century found exactly the same
kinds of textile known in the days of Darius still everywhere,
from the shores of the Mediterranean to the far east. What he
says of Bagdad he repeats in fewer words about many other
cities. In finding their way to England these fabrics received, if
not in all at least in most instances, the names of the seaports in
the Mediterranean where they had been shipped.</p>

<p>For beautifully wrought and figured silk, one of the few terms
that still outlive the mediæval period is Damask.</p>

<p>China, no doubt, was the first country to ornament its silken
webs with a pattern. India, Persia, and Syria, then Byzantine
Greece, followed, but at long intervals between, in China’s footsteps.
Stuffs so figured brought with them to the west the name
“diaspron” or diaper, bestowed upon them at Constantinople.
But about the twelfth century the city of Damascus, even then
long celebrated for its looms, so far outstripped all other places
for beauty of design that her silken textiles were in demand everywhere;
and thus, as often happens, traders fastened the name
of Damascen or Damask upon every silken fabric richly wrought
and curiously designed, no matter whether it came or not from
Damascus. At last, samit, having long been the epithet betokening
all that was rich and good in silk, was forgotten, and
diaper, from being the very word significant of pattern, became
a secondary term descriptive of merely a part in the elaborate
design on damask.</p>

<p>Baudekin, that sort of costly cloth of gold spoken of so much
during so many years in English literature, took (as was said
before) its famous name from Bagdad. Many specimens of baudekin
in the South Kensington collection furnish proofs of the
ancient weavers’ dexterity in their management of the loom, and
especially of the artists’ taste in setting out their intricate and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
beautiful designs. An identification between very many samples
there brought together of ancient textiles in silk and the descriptions
of similar stuffs given us in those valuable records, our old
church inventories, might be carried on if necessary to a very
lengthened extent.</p>

<p>Dorneck was the name given to an inferior kind of damask
wrought of silk, wool, linen thread and gold, in Flanders. This
was manufactured towards the end of the fifteenth century mostly
at Tournay; which city in Flemish was often called Dorneck—a
word variously spelt as Darnec, Darnak, Darnick, and sometimes
even Darness.</p>

<p>The guild of the blessed Virgin at Boston had a care cloth of
“silke dornex” and church furniture. The “care cloth” was a
sort of canopy held over the bride and bridegroom as they knelt
for the nuptial blessing, according to the Salisbury rite, at the
marriage mass. At Exeter dorneck was used in chasubles for
orphreys. A specimen of dorneck may be seen, no. 7058. It is
several times mentioned in the York fabric rolls.</p>

<p>Buckram, so called from Bokkara where it was originally
made, in the middle ages was much esteemed for being costly and
very fine; and consequently fit for use in church vestments and for
secular personal wear. “Panus Tartaricus” or Tartary cloth is
often spoken of. John Grandison, bishop of Exeter in 1327,
gave to his cathedral flags of white and red buckram; and among
the five very rich veils for covering the moveable lectern in that
church three were lined with blue “bokeram.” As late as the
beginning of the sixteenth century this stuff was held good enough
for lining to a black velvet gown for a queen, Elizabeth of York.
The coarse thick fabric which now goes by the name is very
different from the older production known as “bokeram.”</p>

<p>Burdalisaunder, Bordalisaunder, Bourde de Elisandre, with
other varieties in spelling, is a term often to be met with in old
wills and church inventories. In the year 1327 Exeter had a
chasuble of Bourde de Elisandre of divers colours: and from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Yorkshire wills we find that sometimes it was wide enough for
half a piece to form the adornment of a high altar.</p>

<p>“Bord” in Arabic means a striped cloth; and we know, both
from travellers and the importation of the textile itself, that many
tribes in north and eastern Africa weave stuffs for personal wear
of a pattern consisting of white and black longitudinal stripes.
St. Augustin, living in north Africa near the modern Algiers,
speaks of a stuff for clothing called “burda” in the end of the
fourth and beginning of the fifth century. It is not impossible
that the curtains for the tabernacle as well as the girdles for Aaron
and his sons, of fine linen and violet and purple and scarlet twice
dyed, were wrought with this very pattern, so that in the “burd
Alisaunder” we behold the oldest known design for any textile.
This stuff in the middle ages was a silken web in different coloured
stripes, and specimens also may be found at South Kensington.
Though made in many places round the Mediterranean this silk
took its name, at least in England, from Alexandria.</p>

<p>Fustian, of which we still have two forms in velveteen and
corduroy, was originally wove at Fustat on the Nile, with a warp
of linen thread and a woof of thick cotton, so twilled and cut that
it showed on one side a thick but low pile; and the web thus
managed took its name of Fustian from that Egyptian city. At
what period it was invented we do not rightly know, but we are
well aware it must have been brought very early to this country;
for our countryman St. Stephen Harding, when a Cistercian
abbot and an old man about the year 1114, forbade chasubles in
his church to be made of anything but fustian or plain linen.
The austerity of his rule reached even the ornaments of the
church. From such a prohibition we are not to draw as a conclusion
that fustian was at the time a mean material; quite the
contrary, although not splendid it was a seemly textile. Years
afterwards, in the fourteenth century, Chaucer tells us of his
<span class="locked">knight:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of fustian he wered a gepon.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
In the fifteenth century Naples had a repute for weaving
fustians; and our English churchwardens, not being learned in
geography or spelling, made some odd mistakes in their accounts
about this as about some other continental stuffs: “Fuschan
in appules” for fustian from Naples is droll; yet droller
still is “mustyrd devells,” for a cloth made in France at a town
called Mustrevilliers.</p>

<p>Muslin, as it is now throughout the world so from the earliest
antiquity, has been everywhere in Asia in favourite use both as an
article of dress and as furniture. Its cloud-like thinness and its
lightness were not the only charms belonging to this stuff: it was
esteemed equally as much for the taste with which stripes of gold
had been woven in its warp. As we learn from the travels of
Marco Polo, the further all wayfarers in Asia wandered among
eastern nations the higher they found the point of excellence
which had been reached in weaving silk and gold into splendid
fabrics. The silkworm lived and thrived there and the cotton
plant also was in its home, its birth-place, in those regions.</p>

<p>Like many cities of central Asia, Mosul had earned for itself a
reputation of old for the beauty of its gold-wrought silken textiles.
Cotton grew all around in plenty; the inhabitants, especially the
women, were gifted with such quick feeling of finger that they
could spin thread from this cotton of more than hair-like fineness.
Cotton with them took the place of silk in the loom; and gold
was not forgotten in the weaving. Their work, not only because
it was so much cheaper but from its own peculiar beauty and
comeliness, won for itself a high place in common estimation: and
the name of the town where it was wrought in such perfection was
given to it as its distinctive name. Hence, whether wove with or
without gold, we call this cotton web muslin, from the Asiatic city
of Mosul.</p>

<p>Cloth of Areste is another term for woven stuffs, to be found
in our old English deeds and inventories. The first time we
meet it is in an order given, 1244, by Henry the third for finding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
two cloths of Areste with which two copes were to be made for
royal chapels. Again it comes a few years later at St. Paul’s,
which cathedral <span class="smcap smaller">A. D.</span> 1295 had, besides a dalmatic and tunicle
of this silk “white silk of Areste diapered,” as many as thirty and
more hangings of the same texture.</p>

<p>From the description of these pieces we gather that this so-called
cloth of Areste must have been both beautiful and rich,
being for the most part cloth of gold figured elaborately; some
with lions and double-headed eagles, others, for example, with the
death and burial of our Lord.</p>

<p>We are not disposed to agree with the suggestion that this
cloth was a kind of arras. Arras had not won for itself a reputation
for its tapestry before the fourteenth century. Tapestry
itself is too thick and heavy for use in vestments; yet this cloth of
Areste was light enough for tunicles, and when worn out was
sometimes condemned at St. Paul’s to be put aside for lining
other ritual garments. Among the three meanings for the mediæval
“Aresta” one is any kind of covering. It seems, therefore,
probable that these cloths of Areste took their name not
from the place where they had been woven, but from the use to
which they were generally put; namely, for hangings about
churches. Moreover, tapestry or Arras work, being thick and
heavy, could never have been employed for such light use as that
of apparels nor would it have been diapered like silk, yet we find
“Areste” to have been so fashioned and so used.</p>

<p>Silks also were distinguished through their colours and shades
of colours: and the men who drew up the mediæval inventories
seem to have been gifted with a keen eye for varieties of shades
and tints. For instance, a chasuble at St. Paul’s is set down, late
in the thirteenth century, as made of samit dyed in a purple
somewhat bordering on a blood-red tone. Tarsus colour is often
mentioned: and it was, probably, some shade of purple. The
people of Tarsus no doubt got from their murex, a shell-fish of the
class mollusca and purpurifera family to be found on their coast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
their dyeing matter; and when we remember what changes are
wrought in the animal itself by the food it eats, and what strong
effects are made by slight variations in climate, even atmosphere,
upon materials for colouring in the moment of application, we
may easily understand how the difference arose between the two
tints of purple.</p>

<p>“Cloth of Tarsus” itself was of a rare and costly kind, of fine
goats’ hair and silk. The tint was some shade of royal purple.
Chaucer tells us that</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The great Emetrius, the king of Inde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a stede bay, trapped in stele,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Covered with cloth of gold diapred wele,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came riding like the god of armes Mars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cote armure was of a cloth of Tars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Couched with perles, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Other cities besides Tarsus gave their names to various shades
of purple; according as they were dyed at Antioch, Alexandria,
or Naples. Each place had a particular shade which distinguished
it from the others. It is not now possible to ascertain
what were the exact distinctions of tint. Sky-blue was a colour
everywhere in church use for certain festivals throughout England.
In the early inventories the name for that tint is “Indicus,”
“Indus,” reminding us of our present <i>indigo</i>. In later lists it is
called “Blodius,” not sanguinary but blue. Murrey, or a reddish
brown, is also often specified.</p>

<p>Silks woven of two colours, so that one of them showed itself
unmixed and quite distinct on one side, and the second appeared
equally clear on the other—a thing sometimes now looked upon
as a wonder in modern weaving—might occasionally be met with
here at the mediæval period: Exeter cathedral had, in 1327, a silk
cloth “of red colour inside and yellow outside.” At York, in
1543, there was “a vestment of changeable silke,” “besides one
of changeable taffety for Good Friday.”</p>

<p>Marble silk had a weft of several colours so woven as to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
the whole web look like marble, stained with a variety of tints.
There were many such vestments in old St. Paul’s. During full
three centuries this marble silk found great favour among us; for
Henry Machyn, in his curious diary, tells us how “the old qwyne
of Schottes rod thrught London,” and how “then cam the lord
tresorer with a C. gret horsse and ther cotes of marbull,” etc., to
meet her the 6th of November, 1551.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">We</span> must now speak of embroidery. The art of working with the
needle flowers, fruits, human and animal forms, or any fanciful
design, upon webs woven of silk, linen, cotton, wool, hemp, besides
other kinds of stuff, is of the highest antiquity.</p>

<p>Those patterns, after so many fashions, which we see figured
upon the garments worn by men and women on Egyptian and
Assyrian monuments, but especially on the burned-clay vases
made and painted by the Greeks in their earliest as well as
in later times, or which we read about in the writings of that
people, were not wrought in the loom, but worked by the needle.</p>

<p>The old Egyptian loom—and that of the Jews must have been
like it—was, as we know from paintings, of the simplest shape,
and seems to have been able to do little more diversified in
design than straight lines in different colours; and at best nothing
higher in execution than checker-work: beyond this, all was put
in by hand with the needle. In Paris, at the Louvre, are several
pieces of early Egyptian webs coloured, drawings of which have
been published by Sir Gardner Wilkinson in his work ‘The
Egyptians in the time of the Pharaohs.’ There are two pieces
wrought up and down with needlework; the second piece of blue
is figured all over in white embroidery with a pattern of netting,
the meshes of which shut in irregular cubic shapes, and in the
lines of the reticulation the mystic “fylfot” is seen. Sir J. G.
Wilkinson says of them: “They are mostly cotton, and, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
their date is uncertain, they suffice to show that the manufacture
was Egyptian; and the many dresses painted on the monuments
of the eighteenth dynasty show that the most varied patterns
were used by the Egyptians more than 3000 years ago, as they
were at a later period by the Babylonians, who became noted for
their needlework.”</p>

<p>It is clear from the book of Exodus that the Israelites from
very early times, having learnt the art in Egypt, embroidered their
garments; although the word “embroidery” which occurs so
frequently in every English version probably sometimes means
merely weaving in stripes, and not work with the needle. The
embroidering also of the sails of vessels was not uncommon in the
east; boats used in sacred festivals on the Nile were so decorated;
and the prophet Ezekiel says to the people of Tyre, “Fine linen
with broidered work from Egypt, was that which thou spreadest
forth to be thy sail.” The reader will here also remember Shakspeare’s
description of the barge of Cleopatra;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burned on the water:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purple the sails, and so perfumed, that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds were love-sick with them; she did lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her pavilion, cloth of gold, of tissue, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Pliny says that the Phrygians invented embroidery, and that
garments so ornamented were called Phrygionic. Of such a fashion
were “the art-wrought vests of splendid purple tint” brought
forth by Dido, and the cloak given by Andromache to Ascanius.
Hence, an embroiderer was called in Latin “Phrygio,” and
needlework “Phrygium” or “Phrygian” work. When the design,
as often happened, was wrought in solid gold wire or golden
thread, the embroidery so worked was named “auriphrygium.”
From this term comes the old English word “orphrey.”</p>

<p>While Phrygia in general, Babylon in particular (as Pliny also
tells us) became celebrated for the beauty of its embroideries.
All who have seen the sculptures in the British museum brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
from Nineveh, and described and figured by Layard, must have
remarked how lavishly the Assyrians adorned their robes with the
needlework for which one of their greatest cities was so famous.
Up to the first century of our era the reputation which Babylon
had won for her textiles and needlework still lived. We know
from Josephus, who had often been to worship at Jerusalem, that
the veils of the Temple were Babylonian; and of the outer one
that writer says: “there was a veil of equal largeness with the
door. It was a Babylonian curtain, embroidered with blue and
fine linen, and scarlet and purple, and of a texture that was
wonderful.”</p>

<p>What the Jews did for the Temple we may be sure was done
by Christians for the Church. The faithful, however, went even
further, and wore garments figured all over with sacred subjects
in embroidery. We learn this from a stirring sermon preached by
St. Asterius, bishop of Amasia in Pontus, in the fourth century.
Taking for his text “a certain rich man who was clothed in
purple and fine linen” he upbraids the world for its follies in dress,
and complains that some people went about arrayed like painted
walls, with beasts and flowers all over them; while others, pretending
a more serious tone of thought, dressed in clothes depicting
the doings and wonders of our Lord. “Strive,” St.
Asterius exhorts them, “to follow in your lives the teachings of
the Gospel, rather than have the miracles of our Redeemer embroidered
upon your outward dress.” To have had so many
subjects shown upon one garment it is clear that each must have
been done very small, and wrought in outline; a style which is
being brought back, with great effect, into modern ecclesiastical
use.</p>

<p>The discriminating accuracy with which our old writers noted
the several kinds of textile gifts bestowed upon a church is as
instructive as praiseworthy. Ingulph did not think it enough to
say that abbot Egelric had given many hangings to the church at
Croyland, the great number of which were silken, but he explains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
also that some were ornamented with birds wrought in gold and
sewed on; in fact, of cut-work; others with those birds woven
into the stuff; others quite plain. We find the same care taken
in old inventories.</p>

<p>By the latter end of the thirteenth century embroidery obtained
for its several styles and various sorts of ornamentation a
distinguishing and technical nomenclature. One of the earliest
documents in which we meet with this set of terms is the inventory
drawn up, in 1295, of the vestments belonging to St.
Paul’s cathedral, printed by Dugdale: herein, the “opus plumarium,”
the “opus pectineum,” the “opus pulvinarium,” “consutum
de serico,” “de serico consuto,” may be severally found.</p>

<p>“Opus plumarium” was the then usual term for what is now
commonly called embroidery; and was given to needlework of
this kind because the stitches were laid down longwise and not
across: that is, so put together that they seemed to overlap one
another like the feathers in the plumage of a bird. This style
was aptly called “feather-stitch” work, in contradistinction to
that done in cross and tent stitch, or the “cushion-style.”</p>

<p>The “opus pulvinarium,” or “cushion-style,” was like the
modern so-called Berlin work. As now, so then it was done in
the same stitching with pretty much the same materials and
generally, if not always, put to the same purpose; for cushions, to
sit or to kneel upon in church or to uphold the mass-book at the
altar; hence its name of “cushion-style.” In working it silken
thread is known to have been often used. Among other specimens,
and in silk, there is a beautiful cushion of a date corresponding
to the London inventory at South Kensington, no.
1324. Being well adapted for working heraldry this stitch has
been used from an early period for the purpose; and emblazoned
orphreys, like the narrow hem on the Syon cope, were wrought
in it.</p>

<p>The “opus pectineum” was a kind of woven work imitative
of embroidery, and employed to supply it. John Garland, in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
dictionary, explains that it was made by means of a comb, or
some comb-like instrument: and from this the work itself received
the distinctive appellation of “pectineum,” or comb-wrought.
Before John Garland left England for France, to teach
a school there, he must have often seen his countrywomen at
such an occupation; and the amice given by Katherine Lovell to
St. Paul’s, “de opere pectineo,” may perhaps have been the
work of her own hands.</p>

<p>Women in the middle ages were so ready at the needle that
they could make their embroidery look as if it had been done in
the loom, really woven. A shred of crimson cendal figured in
gold and silver thread with a knight on horseback, armed as of
the latter time of Edward the first, was shown to us some time
ago. At first sight the mounted warrior seemed to have been
not hand-worked but woven; so flat, so even was every thread.
Looking at it however through a glass and turning it about, we
found it to have been embroidered by the finger in such a way that
the stitches laid down upon the surface were carried through into
the canvas lining at the back of the thin silk. In this same
manner all the design, both before and behind, upon the fine
English-wrought chasuble at South Kensington, no. 673, was
probably worked.</p>

<p>At the latter end of the thirteenth century our countrywomen
invented a new way of embroidery. Without giving up altogether
the old “opus plumarium” or feather-stitch, they mixed it with a
new style, both of needlework and mechanism. So beautiful was
the novel method deemed abroad that it won for itself the complimentary
appellation of “opus Anglicum,” or English work.
In what its peculiarity consisted has long been a question and a
puzzle among foreign archæological writers; and a living one of
eminence, M. Voisin, noticing a cope of English work given to
the church of Tournai, says: “Il serait curieux de savoir quelle
broderie ou quel tissu on designait sous le nom de <i>opus Anglicum</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
But if we examine that very fine piece of English needlework,
the Syon cope, at South Kensington, no. 9182, we find that the
first stitches for the human face were begun in the centre of the
cheek, and worked in circular lines; falling (after the further side
had been made) into straight lines, which were so carried on
through the rest of the fleshes; in some instances, also, through
the draperies. But this was done in a sort of chain-stitch, and a
newly practised mechanical appliance was brought into use.
After the whole figure had thus been wrought with this kind
of chain-stitch in circles and straight lines, then with a little thin
iron rod ending in a small bulb or smooth knob slightly heated,
those middle spots in the faces that had been worked in circular
lines were pressed down; and the deep wide dimples in the throat,
especially of aged persons. By the hollows thus lastingly sunk
a play of light and shadow is brought out, which at a short distance
lends to the portion so treated the appearance of low relief.
Chain-stitch, then, worked in circular lines and relief given to
parts by hollows sunk into the faces and other portions of the
persons, constitute the elements of the “opus Anglicum,” or
embroidery after the English manner. How the chain-stitch was
worked into circles for the faces, and straight lines for the rest of
the figures, is well shown by a woodcut, after a portion of the
Steeple Aston embroideries, given in the archæological journal,
vol iv. p. 285.</p>

<p>Although not merely the faces and the extremities but the
dresses also of the persons figured were generally wrought in
chain-stitch, and afterwards treated as we have just described,
another practice was to work the draperies in feather-stitch, which
was also employed for the grounding, and diapered after a simple,
zigzag design; as we find in the Syon cope.</p>

<p>How highly English embroideries were at one period appreciated
by foreigners may be gathered from the especial notice
taken of them abroad; as we may find in continental documents.

bishop of Albano, speaks of the English embroideries on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
costly set of white vestments. A bishop of Tournai, in 1343,
bequeathed to that cathedral an old English cope, as well
as a beautiful corporal “of English work.” Among the
copes reserved for prelates’ use in the chapel of Charles duke
of Bourgogne, brother-in-law to John duke of Bedford, there was
one of English work very elaborately fraught with many figures,
as appears from this description of it: “une chappe de brodeure
d’or, façon d’Engleterre, à plusieurs histoires de N.D. et anges et
autres ymages, estans en laceures escriptes, garnie d’un orfroir
d’icelle façon fait à apostres, desquelles les manteulx sont tous
couvertes de perles, et leur diadesmes pourphiler de perles, estans
en manière de tabernacles, faits de deux arbres, dont les tiges sont
touts couvertes de perles, et à la dite chappe y a une bille des
dites armes, garnie de perles comme la dessus dicte.”</p>

<p>While so coveted abroad, our English embroidery was highly
prized and well paid for at home. We find in the Issue Rolls
that Henry the third had a chasuble embroidered by Mabilia of
Bury St. Edmund’s; and that Edward the second paid a hundred
marks to Rose the wife of John de Bureford, a citizen and mercer
of London, for a choir-cope of her embroidering, and which was
to be sent to the Pope as an offering from the queen.</p>

<p>English embroidery afterwards lost its first high reputation.
Through those years wasted with the wars of the Roses the work
of the English needle was very poor, very coarse, and, so to say,
ragged; as, for instance, the chasuble at South Kensington,
no. 4045. Nothing of the celebrated chain-stitch with dimpled
faces in the figures can be found about it: every part is worked in
the feather-stitch, slovenly put down. During the early part of
the seventeenth century our embroiderers again struck out a new
style, which consisted in throwing up the figures a good height
above the grounding. Of this raised work there is a fine specimen
in the fourth of the copes preserved in the chapter library at
Durham. It is said to have been wrought for and given by
Charles the first to that cathedral. This red silk vestment is well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
sprinkled with bodiless cherubic heads crowned with rays and
borne up by wings; while upon the hood is David, holding in one
hand the head of Goliah; the whole done in highly raised embroidery.
Bibles of the large folio size, covered in rich silk or
satin and embroidered with the royal arms done in bold raised-work,
are still to be found in our libraries. More than one of
these volumes is said to have been a gift from the king to a forefather
of the present owner.</p>

<p>This style of raised embroidery remained in use for many years.
Not only large Bibles but smaller volumes, especially prayer-books,
had bindings enriched with it. Generally such examples
are attributed, and in most cases wrongly, to the so-called nuns of
Little Gidding. The same kind of work is sometimes found on
the broad frames of old looking-glasses: setting forth perhaps, as
in the specimen no. 892, the story of Ahasuerus and Esther, or
a passage in some courtship carried on after the manners of
Arcadia.</p>

<p>Few people at the present day have a just idea of the labour,
the money, and the length of time often bestowed of old upon
embroideries, which had been sketched as well as wrought by the
hands of men, each in his own craft the ablest and most cunning
of his time. In behalf of England plenty of evidence has been
produced already: as a proof of the same labour elsewhere a
remarkable passage may be quoted, given, in his life of Antonio
Pollaiuolo, by Vasari: “For San Giovanni in Florence there were
made certain very rich vestments after the design of this master,
all of gold-wove velvet with pile upon pile (di broccato riccio
sopra riccio), each woven of one entire piece and without seam,
embroidered with the most subtile mastery of that art by Paolo da
Verona, a man most eminent of his calling, and of incomparable
ingenuity. This work took twenty-six years for its completion,
being wholly in close stitch (questi ricami fatti con punto serrato);
but the excellent method of which is now all but lost, the custom
being in these days to make the stitches much wider (il punteggiare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
piu largo), whereby the work is rendered less durable and
much less pleasing to the eye.” These vestments may yet be seen
framed and glazed in presses around the sacristy of San Giovanni.
Antonio died in 1498. The magnificent cope before referred to,
now at Stonyhurst, is of one seamless piece of gorgeous gold tissue
figured with bold wide-spreading foliage in crimson velvet, pile
upon pile, and dotted with small gold spots; probably it came
from the same loom that threw off these famous San Giovanni
vestments.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> old English “opus consutum” or cut-work, called in French
“appliqué,” is a term of rather wide meaning, as it takes in several
sorts of decorative accompaniments to needlework.</p>

<p>When anything—flower, fruit, or figure—is wrought by itself
upon a separate piece of silk or canvas and afterwards sewed on
to the vestment for church use, or article for domestic purpose, it
comes to be known as cut-work. This kind of work was employed
for dresses and vestments; but we find it most commonly on bed-curtains,
hangings for rooms and halls, and other items in household
furniture.</p>

<p>Of cut-work in embroidery those pieces of splendid Rhenish
needlework with the blazonment of Cleves, sewed upon a ground
of crimson silk, nos. 1194–5, at South Kensington, and the
chasuble of crimson double-pile velvet, no. 78, are good
examples. In the last, the niches in which the saints stand are
loom-wrought, but those personages themselves are exquisitely
worked on separate pieces of fine canvas and afterwards let into
the unwoven spaces left open for them. A Florentine piece of
cut-work, no. 5788, is alike remarkable for its great beauty and
the skill shown in bringing together both weaving and embroidery.
Much of the architectural accessories is loom-wrought, while the
extremities of the evangelists are all done by the needle; but the
head, neck, and long beard are worked by themselves upon very
fine linen, and afterwards put together in such a way that the full
white beard overlaps the tunic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Other methods gave a quicker help in this cut-work. For the
sake of expedition all the figures were sometimes at once shaped
out of woven silk, satin, velvet, linen, or woollen cloth as wanted,
and sewed upon the grounding of the article: the features of the
face and the contours of the body were then wrought by the needle
in very narrow lines done in brown silk thread. At times, even
this much of embroidery was set aside for the painting brush, and
instances are to be found in which the spaces left uncovered by
the loom for the heads and extremities of the human figures are
filled in with the brush. Sometimes, again, the cut-work done in
these ways is framed, as it were, with an edging, either in plain or
gilt leather, hempen, or silken cord, like the leadings of a stained
glass window. Perhaps in no collection open anywhere to public
view can a piece of cut-work be found so full of teaching about
the process of this easy way of execution as no. 1370 at South
Kensington: and we earnestly recommend the attention of our
readers to that example.</p>

<p>For the invention of cut-work, or “di commesso” as Vasari
calls it, that writer tells us we are indebted to one of his
Florentine countrymen: “It was by Sandro Botticelli that the
method of preparing banners and standards in what is called cut-work
was invented; and this he did that the colours might not
sink through, showing the tint of the cloth on each side. The
baldachino of Orsanmichele is by this master, and is so
treated, etc.” But Vasari is not correct: the piece just
spoken of, no. 1370, was made half a century before Botticelli
was born.</p>

<p>There are other accessories in mediæval embroidery which
ought not to be overlooked.</p>

<p>In some few instances, gold and silver gilt star-like flowers are
to be found sewed upon the silks or amid the embroidery from
Venice and other provinces in Italy, and from southern Germany.
Some fragments of silk damask, no. 8612, are curious examples of
Italian taste. These at one time have been thickly strewed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
trefoils cut out of gilt metal but very thin, and not sewed but glued
on to the silk: many of the leaves have fallen off, and those
remaining turned black. Precious stones also, coral, and seed
pearls were sewed upon textiles; and, not uncommonly, small
coloured beads and bugles of glass. Belonging to St. Paul’s, in
1295, among many other amices there was one having glass stones
upon it, both large and small.</p>

<p>Another form of glass fastened by heat to gold and copper,
enamel, was extensively employed as an adornment upon textiles.
The gorgeous “chesable of red cloth of gold with orphreys before
and behind set with pearls, blue, white, and red, with plates of
gold enamelled, wanting fifteen plates, etc.,” described in
Dugdale’s Monasticon, and given by John of Gaunt’s duchess
to Lincoln cathedral, shows how this rich ornamentation was
applied to garments, especially for church use, in very large
quantities.</p>

<p>In England the old custom was to sew a great deal of goldsmith’s
work, for enrichment, upon articles meant for personal
wear. When our first Edward’s grave in Westminster abbey was
opened in 1774 there was seen upon the body, besides other
silken robes, a stole-like band of rich white tissue about the neck
and crossed upon the breast: it was studded with gilt quatrefoils
in filigree work and embroidered with pearls. From the knees
downwards the body was wrapped in a pall of cloth of gold.
Henry the third gave a frontal to the high altar in Westminster
abbey upon which, besides carbuncles in golden settings and
several large pieces of enamel, were as many as 866 smaller ones:
perhaps the “esmaux de plique” of the French.</p>

<p>In the Norman-French silken stuffs thus ornamented were said
to be “batuz,” that is, beaten with hammered-up gold. The
Treasury calendars, edited by Palgrave, tell us that Richard the
second gave to the chapel in the castle of Haverford “ii rydell
batuz;” two altar-curtains beaten (probably with ornaments in
gilt silver; like an amice so described which belonged to St. Paul’s).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
For the secular employment of this same sort of decoration we
have several curious examples. Ladies’ dresses were so adorned,
as we may see in these verses:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="caption">Ancient banner of the city of Strasburg: see next page.</div></div>

<p>King John in 1215 sent an order (extant in the Close rolls)
to Reginald de Cornhull and William Cook to have made for him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
besides five tunics, five banners with his arms upon them,
well beaten in gold: “bene auro batuatas.” A very remarkable
example attributed to the fourteenth century “the banner of
Strasbourg” was preserved there until very lately, when it
was unhappily destroyed in the bombardment of that city in
1870.</p>

<p>Dugdale (in his Baronage) gives the original bill for fitting out
one of the ships in which Beauchamp earl of Warwick, during the
reign of Henry the sixth, went over to France. Among other items
are these: “Four hundred pencils (long narrow strips of silk, used
as flags) beat with the raggedstaff in silver; the other pavys (one
of two shields probably of wood, and fastened outside the ship at
its bows) painted with black, and a raggedstaff beat with silver
occupying all the field; one coat for my lord’s body, beat with
fine gold; two coats for heralds, beat with demi gold; a great
streamer for a ship of forty yeards in length and eight yeards in
breadth, with a great bear and griffin holding a raggedstaff poudred
full of raggedstaffs; three penons (small flags) of satten; sixteen
standards of worsted entailed with the bear and a chain.” The
quatrefoils on the robe of Edward the first, the silver lions on the
Glastonbury cope, the beasts and birds on the lady’s gown, the
bear and griffin and raggedstaff belonging to the Beauchamp’s
blazoning, and all similar enrichments put upon silken stuffs, were
cut out of very thin plates of gold or silver, so as to hang upon
them lightly, and were hammered up to show in low relief the
fashion of the flower and the lineaments of the beast or bird meant
to be represented. Such a style of ornamentation in gold or silver,
stitched on silken stuffs, was far more common once than is now
thought. It had also a technical description: in speaking of it
people would either write or say, “silk beaten with gold or silver;”
as, for example, Barbara Mason used the term when in 1538 she
bequeathed to a church “a vestment of grene sylke betyn with
goold.”</p>

<p>Spangles, when they happened to be used, were not like those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
now employed but fashioned after another and artistic shape, and
put on in a different manner. A fragment still exists from the
chasuble belonging to the set of vestments wrought, it is said, by
Isabella of Spain and her maids of honour; and used the first time
high mass was sung in Granada, after it had been taken by the
Spaniards from the Moors. Upon this are flowers, well thrown up
in relief, done in spangles on a crimson velvet ground. The
spangles—some in gold, some in silver—are, though small, of
several sizes; all are voided; that is, hollow in the middle;
with the circumference not flat but convex, and are sewed on
like tiles, one overlapping the other, producing a rich and
pleasing effect. Our present spangles, in the flat shape, are quite
modern.</p>

<p>Another kind of embroidery for garments was in gold, worked
sometimes by itself, sometimes with coloured silk thread laid down
alternately beside it; so as to lend a tinge of green, crimson, pink,
or blue to the imagined tissue of the robe, as if it were made of a
golden stuff shot with another tint.</p>

<p>This gold “passing” was sewn on. The workwomen taking
thin silk, while fastening the passing, dotted it all over in small
stitches set exactly in a way that showed the same pattern. With
no other appliance they were thus enabled to lend to their draperies
the appearance of having been not wrought by the needle but
actually cut out of a piece of textile; for which they have been
sometimes mistaken.</p>

<p>Anciently, also, in England another mode of embroidering
articles, either for church use or for household furniture, was by
darning or working the subject upon linen netting. This was
called net-work, filatorium, as we learn from the Exeter inventory,
where we read that its cathedral possessed in 1327 three pieces of
it for use at the altar: one in particular for throwing over the desk.
These thread embroideries were chiefly wrought during the fourteenth
century; but as early as 1295 St. Paul’s had a cushion of
the kind.</p>

<p>Crochet, knitting done with linen thread, and the thick
kinds of lace wrought (chiefly in Flanders) upon the cushion
with bobbins, were much employed under the name of nun’s
lace from the sixteenth century and upwards, for bordering
altar-cloths, albs, and every sort of towel required for church
purposes.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Tapestry</span> is neither real weaving nor true embroidery, but in a
manner unites in its working those two processes into one.
Though wrought in a loom and upon a warp stretched out along
its frame, it has no woof thrown across those threads with a shuttle
or any like appliance but its weft is done with many short threads,
all variously coloured and put in by a needle. It is not embroidery,
though so very like it, for tapestry is not worked upon what
is really a web, having both warp and woof, but upon a series of
closely set fine strings.</p>

<p>From the way in which tapestry is spoken of in Holy Writ
we may be sure that the art is very old; and if it did not take
its first rise in Egypt, we are led by the same authority to conclude
that it soon became successfully cultivated by the people of that
land. The woman in the book of Proverbs says: “I have woven
my bed with cords. I have covered it with painted tapestry,
brought from Egypt.” We find, therefore, not only that it was
employed as an article of household furniture among the Israelites,
but that the Egyptians were the makers.</p>

<p>From Egypt through western Asia the art of tapestry-making
found its way to Europe, and after many ages at last to England.
Among the other manual labours followed in religious houses
this handicraft was one; and monks became some of the best
workmen. The altars and the walls of their churches were hung
with tapestry. Matthew Paris tells us that among other ornaments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
which, in the reign of Henry the first, abbot Geoffrey had made
for his church of St. Alban’s were three reredoses; the first a large
one wrought with the finding of the body of St. Alban; the other
two figured with the parables of the man who fell among thieves,
and of the prodigal son. While in London in the year 1316 Simon
abbot of Ramsey bought looms, staves, shuttles, and a slay: “pro
weblomes emptis xx<sup>s</sup>. Et pro staves ad easdem vj<sup>d</sup>. Item pro
iiij shittles pro eodem opere ij<sup>s</sup> vj<sup>d</sup>. Item in j. slay pro textoribus
viij<sup>d</sup>.” Collier, in his history, quotes a letter from Giffard, one of
the commissioners for the suppression of the smaller houses, written
to Cromwell; in which he says, speaking of the monastery of
Wolstrope in Lincolnshire: “Not one religious person there but
that he can and doth use either imbrothering, writing books with
very fair hand, making their own garments, carving, painting, or
graving, etc.”</p>

<p>We may collect from Chaucer that working tapestry was not
an uncommon trade; among his pilgrims he mentions in the
prologue,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An haberdasher and a carpenter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A webbe, a dyer, and a tapisser.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Pieces of English-made tapestry still remain. That fine though
greatly damaged specimen at St. Mary’s hall, Coventry, representing
the marriage of Henry the sixth, is one; a second is the curious
reredos for an altar, belonging to the vintner’s company; this last
is figured with St. Martin on horseback cutting his cloak in two
that he might give one half to a poor man, and with St. Dunstan
singing mass. A third piece, of large size and in good preservation,
is in private possession, and hangs upon the wall in a house
in Cornwall. It is one of four pieces, of which two have been
lost, representing the marriage of Henry the seventh and Elizabeth
of York; and was probably made about the year 1490.</p>

<p>The art of weaving tapestry was successfully followed in many
parts of France and throughout ancient Flanders; where secular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
trade-guilds were formed for its especial manufacture in many of
the towns. Several of these places won for themselves an especial
fame; but so far, at last, did Arras outrun them all that arras-work
came to be the common word, both here and on the continent, to
mean all sorts of tapestry, whether wrought in England or abroad.
Thus the fine hangings for the choir of Canterbury cathedral,
now at Aix-en-Provence, though probably made at home by his
own monks and given to that church by prior Goldston in 1595,
are spoken of as arras-work: “de arysse subtiliter intextos.”</p>

<div id="ip_97" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 11em;">

  <div class="caption">Banner of the tapestry workers of Lyons.</div></div>

<p>Arras is but one among other terms by which, during the middle
ages, tapestry was called. Its earliest name was Saracenic work;
“opus Saracenicum;” and, at first, tapestry was wrought as in the
east, in a low or horizontal loom. The artisans of France and
Flanders were the first to introduce the upright or vertical frame,
afterwards known abroad as “de haute lisse,” in contradistinction
to the low or horizontal frame called “de basse lisse.” Workmen
who kept to the unimproved loom were known, in the trade, as
Saracens, for retaining the method of their paynim teachers; and
their work, Saracenic. In the year 1339 John de Croisettes, a
Saracen-tapestry worker living at Arras, sells to the duke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Touraine a piece of gold Saracenic tapestry figured with the story
of Charlemagne: “Jean de Croisettes, tapissier Sarrazinois demeurant
à Arras, vend au duc de Touraine un tapis sarrazinois à or de
l’histoire de Charlemaine.” The high frame, however, soon superseded
the low one; and among the pieces of tapestry belonging
to Philippe duke of Bourgogne and Brabant many are especially
entered as of the high frame; one of which is thus described:
“ung grant tapiz de haulte lice, sauz or, de l’istoire du duc
Guillaume de Normandie comment il conquist Engleterre.” A
very fine example is still to be seen in the collection at the Louvre,
representing the history of St. Martin.</p>

<div id="ip_98" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_098.jpg" width="442" height="339" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">The legend of St. Martin.—From a piece of tapestry of the fourteenth century
in the Louvre.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
With the upright, as with the flat frame, the workman had to
grope in the dark a great deal upon his path. In both, he was
obliged to put in the threads on the back or wrong side of the
piece, following his sketch as best he could behind the strings or
warp. As the face was downward in the flat frame it was much
less easy to observe and correct a fault. In the upright frame he
might go in front, and with his own work in open view on one
hand and the original design full before him on the other, he
could mend as he went on, step by step, the smallest mistake,
were it but a single thread. Put side by side, when finished, the
pieces from the upright frame were in beauty and perfection far
beyond those from the flat one. We can scarcely particularize
the details in which that superiority consisted, for not one single
flat sample is to be identified as certain from evidence within our
reach. It is possible that at South Kensington the specimens
nos. 1296 and 1465 are “Saracenic;” that is, wrought in the low
flat loom, or “de basse lisse;” but all the rest are of the
“de haute lisse,” worked in the upright frame. The “weaver” is
among the trades engraved in the curious volume printed at
Frankfort in 1574, <i>de mechanicis artibus</i>, with plates by Amman.</p>

<p>When the illuminators of manuscripts began to put in golden
shadings all over their painting the tapestry-workers did the
same. Such a manner cannot be relied on as a criterion whereby
to judge of the exact place where any specimen of tapestry had
been wrought, or to tell its precise age. To work figures on a
golden ground and to shade garments, buildings, and landscapes
with gold, are two different things. Upon several pieces at South
Kensington gold thread has been very plentifully used, but the
metal is of so debased a quality that it has become almost black.</p>

<p>The use of tapestry for church decoration and household
furniture, both in England and abroad, was for a long period
very great. Many large pieces, mostly of a scriptural character,
were provided by cardinal Wolsey for his palace at Hampton
court. In the next generation, a very famous set was made in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
Flanders, which for many years decorated the walls of the House
of Lords: it represented the defeat of the Spanish Armada. This
magnificent memorial was destroyed in the fire of 1834. One
fragment only is known to exist. This piece was cut out to make
way for a gallery at the time of the trial of queen Caroline, and
was secreted by a German servant of the Lord Chamberlain.
The relic was bought some years after for £20 and presented to
the corporation of Plymouth, who still possess it.</p>

<p>The most beautiful series now in the world is in the Vatican at
Rome, and may be judged of by looking at a few of the original cartoons
(at present in the S. K. museum). Duke Cosimo tried to set
up tapestry work at Florence but did not succeed. Later, Rome
produced some good things; among others, the fine copy of Da
Vinci’s Last Supper still hung up on Maunday Thursday. England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
made several attempts to re-introduce the manufacture: first
at Mortlake, then afterwards in London, at Soho. Works from
these two establishments may be met with. At Northumberland
house there was a room hung with large pieces of tapestry wrought
at Soho, and for that mansion, in the year 1758. The designs
were by Francesco Zuccherelli and consisted of landscapes composed
of hills crowned here and there with the standing ruins of
temples or strewed with broken columns, among which groups
of country folks are wandering and amusing themselves. Mortlake
and Soho were failures. Not so the Gobelins at Paris, as
every one well knows.</p>

<p>In many English houses, especially in the country, good
samples of late Flemish tapestry may be found. Close to London,
Holland house is adorned with some curious specimens, particularly
in the raised style. An earlier example (engraved on the
next page) of the fifteenth century, representing the marriage of
Louis XII. and Anne of Brittany is in a foreign collection.</p>

<p>Imitated tapestry existed here long ago under the name of
“stayned cloth,” and the workers of it were embodied into a
London guild. At the beginning of the sixteenth century Exeter
cathedral had several pieces of old painted or “stayned” cloth:
“i front stayned cum crucifixo, Maria et Johanne, Petro et Paulo;
viij panni linei stayned, etc.” The great use at that time of such
articles in household furniture may be witnessed in the will, 1503,
of Katherine lady Hastings who bequeaths, besides several other
such pieces, “an old hangin of counterfeit arres of Knollys, which
now hangeth in the hall and all such hangyings of old bawdekyn,
or lynen paynted as now hang in the chappell.” We may also
remember that Falstaff speaks of it as an illustration easily understood;
he says that his troops are “as ragged as Lazarus in the
painted cloth.”</p>

<p>Carpets are akin to tapestry, and though the use of them may
perhaps be not so ancient yet is very old. Here, again, we must
look to the people of Asia for the finest as well as the earliest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
examples of this textile. Mediæval specimens are rare anywhere,
and we are glad to recommend attention to two pieces of that
period fortunately in the collection at South Kensington, no. 8649,
of the fourteenth century, and no. 8357, of the sixteenth, both of
Spanish make.</p>

<p>The chambers of our royal palaces and the chancels of our
parish churches used to be strewed with rushes. When however
they could afford it the authorities of our cathedrals, even in very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
early times, spread the sanctuary with carpets; and at last old
tapestry came to be so employed, as now in Italy. Among such
coverings for the floor before the altar Exeter had a large piece of
Arras cloth figured with the life of the duke of Burgundy, the gift
of one of its bishops, Edmund Lacy, in 1420; besides two large
carpets, one bestowed by bishop Nevill in 1456, the other, of a
chequered pattern, by lady Elizabeth Courtney: “carpet et
panni coram altari sternendi; i pannus de Arys de historia ducis
Burgundie; i larga carpeta, etc.” In an earlier inventory we find
that among the “bancaria” or bench-coverings in the choir of the
same cathedral, one was a large piece of English-made tapestry
with a fretted pattern. It is very probable that as the work of the
Record Commission goes on, and our ancient historians are
printed, evidence may be found that the looms at work in all our
great monasteries among other webs wrought carpets. From
existing testimony we believe that such must have been the practice
at Croyland, where abbot Egelric (the second of the name)
gave to that church, before the year 992, “two large foot-cloths
[so carpets were then called] woven with lions to be laid out
before the high altar on great festivals, and two shorter ones
trailed all over with flowers, for the feast days of the apostles.”
The quantity of carpeting in our palaces may be seen by the way
in which Leland tells us that “my lady the queen’s rooms” were
strewed with them “when she took her chamber.”</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> value of such a collection of textile fabrics as that at South
Kensington can scarcely be overrated. Without such aid it is
not possible for the painter or the historian to bring before his
own mind, much less bring before another’s, a true representation
of ancient ceremonies and pageants. Whether his subject be a
coronation or a royal marriage, a queen’s “taking her chamber,”
a progress, or a funeral, he cannot correctly set forth the splendour
or the details of the occasion, unless he can refer to existing
examples of the cloths of gold, the figured velvets, the rich embroidery,
or the splendid silks, which used to be worn of old. Take
for example nos. 1310 and 8624. Upon these are figured stags
with tall branching horns, couchant, chained, upturning their
antlered heads to sunbeams darting down upon them amid a
shower of rain; and beneath the stags are eagles. This Sicilian
textile, woven about the end of the fourteenth century, brings to
one’s mind the bronze recumbent figure of a king in Westminster
abbey. It is that of Richard the second; made for him before his
downfall, and by two coppersmiths of London, Nicholas Broker
and Godfrey Prest. This effigy, once finely gilt, is as remarkable
for its beautiful workmanship as for the elaborate manner in which
the cloak and kirtle worn by the king are diapered all over with a
pattern, copied from the silken stuff out of which those garments
must have been cut for his personal wear while living. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
pattern consists of a sprig of the planta genesta, the humble
broom plant—the haughty Plantagenet’s device—along with a
couchant hart chained and gazing straight forwards, and above it
a cloud with rays darting up from behind. These were Richard’s
favourite cognizances: the one from his grandfather Edward the
third; the other from his mother Joan of Kent. It is very probable
that the king’s dress was of the same kind of silk Sicilian
textile as the examples just referred to: and that those very
examples are portions of pieces wrought, perhaps at Palermo, for
the court of Richard. They are of the same date and they show
his devices; the chained hart and the sunbeams issuing from a
cloud.</p>

<p>The seemliness, not to say comfort, of private life was improved
by the use of textiles. Let the historian contrast the
custom even in a royal palace, during the middle ages, with that
now followed in every tradesman’s home. Then straw and rushes
were strewed in houses upon the floor in every room; and Wendover,
in his life of St. Thomas, speaks of the king’s courtiers
platting knots with the litter, and flinging them with a gibe at a
man who had been slighted by the prince. Not quite a hundred
years later when Eleanor of Castile came to London for her
marriage with our first Edward she found her lodgings furnished,
under the directions of the Spanish courtiers who had arrived
before her, with hangings and curtains of silk around the walls,
and carpets spread upon the ground. This offended some of the
people; more of them, as Matthew Paris records, laughed at the
thought that such costly things were laid down to be walked
upon.</p>

<p>Take, again, the famous Syon cope. Not only is it full of
interest to writers upon liturgies and rituals but of even more to
the herald and genealogist. Covered as its orphreys are with
armorial bearings, this cope carries with it evidences as important
and as valuable as any contemporary roll of arms; and no inquirer
into the pedigrees of the ancient families of the Percies or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
Ferrers, of Cliffords or Botelers, and of many others, can afford to
neglect it.</p>

<p>We have several records of evidence in courts of law taken
from heraldic embroideries upon robes and vestments. In the
famous controversy between the houses of Scrope and Grosvenor,
in the fourteenth century, inquiries were made and proofs were
offered on both sides as to the right of bearing upon their shields
the bend <i>or</i> upon a field <i>azure</i>. Witnesses produced at Westminster
corporas cases, copes, and albs embroidered with the arms
of Scrope. Chaucer was one of the witnesses; and said he had
seen those arms on banners and vestments and commonly called
the arms of Scrope. Again; the fact that in her wardrobe was
found a vestment embroidered with the royal arms was brought
forward to prove the charge of treason against the old countess of
Salisbury, the mother of cardinal Pole; and for which crime she
was condemned.</p>

<p>Collections of ancient textiles are of still greater use to students
of ecclesiastical history and church rituals than even to the
secular historian. It is probable that the greater number of the
specimens which now exist formed originally portions of sacred
vestments and furniture for altars. Formerly so common, fragments
even of such cloths and robes have become of very great
rarity, especially in England; where for the last two or three
centuries the use of the numerous old church vestments and decorations
has entirely ceased.</p>

<p>Again, for example: the three cases nos. 5958, 8329, and
8327 are of the kind known as the “capsella cum serico decenter
ornata” of the mediæval writers; small cases or boxes decently
fitted up with silk; or the “capsula corporalium,” the box in
which were kept the corporals or square pieces of fine linen,
required for service during holy week. The name as well as the
use of this appliance is very old, and both are spoken of in the
very ancient ‘Ordines Romani’ edited by Mabillon. One of
these, in the rubric for Good Friday, speaks of the Host as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
having been kept in the corporal’s case or box: “in capsula corporialium.”
In England, such small wooden boxes covered with
silks and velvets richly embroidered were once employed for the
same purpose: and several are mentioned in the Exeter inventories.</p>

<p>The two pyx-cloths, nos. 8342 and 8691, have an especial
interest for the student of mediæval liturgy. There was a custom
during the middle ages in England, as well as in France and
several other countries on the continent, of keeping the Eucharist
hung up over the high altar beneath a canopy, within a pyx of
gold, silver, ivory, or enamel, mantled with a fine linen cloth or
veil. This veil for the pyx was sometimes embroidered with
golden thread and coloured silks. Such an one is mentioned in
the records of the Exchequer, edited by Palgrave: among the
valuables belonging to Richard the second in Haverford castle
and sent by the sheriff of Hereford to the exchequer, at the
beginning of the reign of Henry the fourth, were “i coupe d’or
pour le Corps Ihu Cryst. i towayll ove (avec) i longe parure de
mesure la suyte.”</p>

<p>Several names were given to this fine linen covering. In the
inventory of things taken from Dr. Caius, and in the college of his
own founding at Cambridge, are “corporas clothes, with the pix
and ‘sindon’ and canopie.” This variety in nomenclature doubtless
has led some writers to state that before Mary queen of Scots
laid her head upon the block she had a “corporal,” strictly so
called, bound over her eyes: as it is given in one of our histories
of England, “a handkerchief in which the Eucharist had formerly
been enclosed.” But this bandage must have been the veil for a
pyx. As Mary wrought much with her needle, and specimens of
her work yet remain at Chatsworth and at Greystock, this piece
may have been embroidered by her own hand and perhaps also
had been once used.</p>

<p>One of these old English pyx or Corpus Christi cloths, was
found a few years ago at the bottom of a chest in Hessett church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
Suffolk. As it is a remarkable specimen of the ingenious handicraft
of our mediæval countrywomen it deserves description. To
make this pyx-cloth a piece of thick linen, about two feet square,
was chosen, and being marked off into small equal widths on all
its four edges, the threads at every other space were, both in the
warp and woof, pulled out. The checquers or squares so produced
were then drawn in by threads tied on the under side,
having the shape of stars, so well and delicately worked that, till
it had been narrowly looked into, the piece was thought to be
guipure lace. An old alb, no. 8710, and an amice, 8307, having
the apparels yet remaining upon both, are well worth attention on
account of somewhat similar curious ornamental needlework in
an intricate manner. In the middle ages in England it was not
unusual to suspend upon pastoral staffs, just below the crook,
a piece of fine linen. We see them represented on effigies and in
illuminations; but existing examples are of the utmost rarity.
Two are at South Kensington: nos. 8279 A, and 8662.</p>

<p>There are also there several specimens of the christening
cloaks, anciently in use. These were not only conspicuous in
royal christenings but, varying in costliness according to the
parent’s rank, were handed down in inventories and wills. At the
christening of Arthur prince of Wales, eldest son of Henry the
eighth, “my lady Cecill, the queen’s eldest sister, bare the prince
wrapped in a mantell of cremesyn clothe of golde furred with
ermyn,” etc. Shakespeare makes the shepherd, in the Winter’s
tale, cry out, “Here’s a sight for thee; look thee, a bearing cloth
for a squire’s child!” A well-to-do tradesman, whose will is
printed among the Bury wills, bequeathed in 1648 to his daughter
Rose his “beareing cloath, such ... linnen as is belonginge
to infants at their tyme of baptisme.”</p>

<p>Small square pieces of embroidered linen are sometimes found
in country houses in some old chest, of which the original use is
said not to be now known. But in most cases these were made
for children’s quilts; and very often have the emblems of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
evangelists figured at the corners: reminding us of the nursery
rhyme, once common both in England and <span class="locked">abroad—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bless the bed that I lie on.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The quilts also for grown people were ornamented in the same
way. At Durham, in 1446, in the dormitory of the priory was a
quilt “cum iiij or evangelistis in corneriis.”</p>

<p>Very few examples now exist of the ceremonial shoe anciently
worn by bishops. These were of velvet, or damask, or strong
linen embroidered. One is preserved at South Kensington, no.
1290: another, once worn by Waynflete bishop of Winchester, is
still at Magdalen college, Oxford. We learn from the York wills
that these shoes were a part of the episcopal vestments: bishop
Pudsey left his mitre, staff, and sandals, “et cætera episcopalia”
to Durham cathedral in 1195. Later the name of “sabatines”
was given them; and archbishop Bowet’s inventory mentions two
pairs: “pro j pare de sabbatones, brouddird et couch’ cum
perell’; pro j pare de sabbatones de albo panno auri.”</p>

<p>Collections of textile fabrics are of the highest value to the
artist. There is none, anywhere, so rich or complete as that at
South Kensington; and before it was purchased for public use,
painters were glad to refer to any scanty collection in private
hands, or to old pictures or illuminated manuscripts, or engravings.</p>

<p>But, now, artists may see pieces of the actual stuffs represented
in the pictures, say, of the national Gallery. For example: in
Orcagna’s coronation of the blessed Virgin the blue silk diapered
in gold, with flowers and birds, hung as a back ground; our
Lord’s white tunic diapered in gold with foliage; the mantle of
His mother made of the same stuff; St. Stephen’s dalmatic of
green samit, diapered with golden foliage, are Sicilian in design
and copied from the rich silks which came, in the middle of the
fourteenth century, from the looms of Palermo. While standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
before Jacopo di Casentino’s St. John our eye is drawn to the
orphrey on that evangelist’s chasuble embroidered, after the
Tuscan style, with barbed quatrefoils, shutting in the busts of
apostles. Isotta da Ramini, in her portrait by Pietro della Francesca,
wears a gown made of velvet and gold like the cut velvets
at South Kensington.</p>

<p>So, again, instead of copying patterns taken from the rich
cloth of gold worn by St. Laurence in Francia’s picture, or from
the mantle of the doge in that by Cappaccio, or from the foot-cloths
on the steps in the pictures by Melozzo da Forli, he may
find for his authorities in the same collection existing specimens of
contemporary and similar fabrics.</p>

<p>Not merely artists of a higher class but decorators also may
be equally benefited by the patterns and examples preserved of
old wall-hangings and tapestry. From early times up to the
middle of the sixteenth century our cathedrals and parish
churches, our castles and manorial houses, in short the dwellings
of the wealthy everywhere, used to be ornamented with wall-painting
done not in “fresco” but in “secco;” that is, distemper.
Upon high festivals the walls of the churches were overspread
with tapestry and needlework; so, too, those in the halls of
palaces, for some solemn ceremonial.</p>

<p>Warton, in his history of English poetry, gives a passage from
Bradshaw’s life of St. Werburgh written late in the sixteenth
century, from which a few lines are well worth quotation. He is
describing how a large hall was arrayed for a great feast:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>Dominus Deus Sabaoth</i>, thre persons in one deyte.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Specimens of tapestry of the later mediæval period may not
uncommonly be found: but not so pieces of room hangings,
“hallings,” such as those at South Kensington, nos. 1370, 1297,
and 1465. Similar examples are, we believe, unknown.</p>

<p>We will add a few words only on one other, and that not
a trivial, part of ancient dress; namely, gloves. Formerly
these were much more ornamented than now; and, when
meant for ladies’ wear, sometimes perfume was bestowed upon
them. Among the new year’s day presents to queen Mary,
before she came to the throne, was “a payr of gloves embrawret
with gold.” A year afterwards “x payr of Spanyneshe gloves
from a duches in Spayne” came to her; and but a month before,
Mrs. Whellers had sent to her highness “a pair of swete gloves.”
Shakespeare, true to the manners of his day, after making Autolycus
chant the praises of his</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lawn as white as driven snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cyprus, black as e’er was crow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gloves, as sweet as damask roses;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">puts this into the mouth of the shepherdess: “Come, you promised
me a tawdry lace, and a pair of sweet gloves.” We may
find a pair of such gloves in the South Kensington collection, no.
4665.</p>

<p>It may be proper to add, in conclusion, that the greater part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
of the very valuable and extensive collection of mediæval textile
fabrics at South Kensington was collected by Dr. Bock, a canon
of Aix la Chapelle; and purchased from him about the year
1864.</p>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made
consistent when a predominant preference was found
in the original book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced
quotation marks were remedied when the change was
obvious, and otherwise left unbalanced.</p>

<p>The index was not fully checked for proper alphabetization
or correct page references.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#loi">List of Woodcuts</a>, the reference to the illustration on page <a href="#ip_94">94</a>
was added by the Transcriber.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_19">19</a>: “ř” represents an “r” with a tilde “~”;
“š” represents an “s” with a tilde “~”.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#Page_19">19</a> and <a href="#Page_96">96</a>: Letters preceded by “^” are
superscripts.</p>

<p>Pages <a href="#Page_36">36</a>, <a href="#Page_37">37</a>, <a href="#Page_38">38</a>: the illustrations on these pages are multi-part
symbols. In the original book, they were printed in-line with the
surrounding text, but in this eBook, they are shown on lines of
their own.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_110">110</a>: “Isotta da Ramini, in her portrait
by Pietro della Francesca” was printed that way,
as was “Cappaccio”.</p>
